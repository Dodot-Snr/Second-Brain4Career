Debugging Git is an essential skill for any advanced user. It involves understanding how to diagnose and resolve issues that arise during version control operations. This can range from identifying the source of a corrupted repository to unraveling complex merge conflicts or understanding why a particular command isn't behaving as expected. Effective debugging often requires a combination of Git commands, log analysis, and a solid understanding of Git's internal workings.

One common debugging scenario involves using `git bisect` to pinpoint the commit that introduced a bug. This powerful tool automates the process of binary search through your commit history, allowing you to quickly identify the problematic commit. For example, if you know that your code worked in version `v1.0` but is broken in the current `HEAD`, you can start a bisect session with `git bisect start v1.0 HEAD`, then mark commits as good or bad until the culprit is found. Another useful technique is examining the reflog (`git reflog`) to recover lost commits or understand the history of branch movements. This can be invaluable when you accidentally delete a branch or need to revert to a previous state.
