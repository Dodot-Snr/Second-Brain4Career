Merge conflicts are an inevitable part of collaborative software development. They arise when Git is unable to automatically reconcile changes from different branches during a merge or rebase operation. This typically happens when the same lines of a file have been modified in different ways on different branches. Understanding how to identify, analyze, and resolve these conflicts is crucial for maintaining a clean and functional codebase.

When a merge conflict occurs, Git marks the conflicting sections in the affected files with special markers: `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch-name`. The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents the changes from the current branch (HEAD), while the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch-name` represents the changes from the branch being merged. To resolve the conflict, you must manually edit the file, choosing which changes to keep, modify, or combine.

For example, imagine two developers working on the same `README.md` file. One developer adds a new feature description on branch `feature-a`, while the other adds a different description on branch `feature-b`. When attempting to merge `feature-b` into `feature-a`, a conflict will occur in the section describing the features. The developer resolving the conflict must then decide which description is more accurate, combine them, or rewrite the section entirely. After resolving the conflict, you stage the changes (`git add <file>`) and commit (`git commit`) to complete the merge.
