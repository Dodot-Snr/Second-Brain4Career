Container orchestration is the automated management, scheduling, and scaling of containerized applications. While containerization packages applications and their dependencies, orchestration tools manage the lifecycle of these containers across multiple hosts, ensuring high availability, efficient resource utilization, and simplified deployment. Without orchestration, managing a large number of containers manually becomes incredibly complex and error-prone.

These tools automate tasks such as deploying containers, scaling them up or down based on demand, managing networking between containers, monitoring their health, and automatically restarting failed containers. This allows developers and operations teams to focus on building and improving applications rather than spending time on infrastructure management.

A key example is Kubernetes, a widely adopted open-source container orchestration platform. Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Another example is Docker Swarm, Docker's native orchestration solution, which provides a simpler setup for smaller deployments.
