Even experienced Git users encounter problems. Understanding common issues and their solutions is crucial for efficient collaboration and maintaining a clean project history. This section will cover frequent pitfalls and provide practical strategies for resolving them.

Some common problems include merge conflicts, which arise when Git can't automatically reconcile changes from different branches. For example, if two developers edit the same line in a file on separate branches, a merge conflict will occur when attempting to merge those branches. Another frequent issue is accidentally committing sensitive data, like API keys or passwords.

We'll explore solutions for these and other common Git problems, such as dealing with large files, undoing mistakes, and recovering lost commits. By mastering these techniques, you'll be better equipped to handle real-world Git scenarios and maintain a smooth workflow.
