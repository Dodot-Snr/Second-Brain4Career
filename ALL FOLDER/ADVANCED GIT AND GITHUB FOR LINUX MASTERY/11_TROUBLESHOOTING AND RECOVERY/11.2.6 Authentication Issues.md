Authentication issues are a common stumbling block when working with Git and GitHub, especially when transitioning between different environments or after password changes. These problems typically arise when Git cannot verify your identity with the remote repository, preventing you from pushing, pulling, or cloning. This often manifests as errors related to incorrect credentials, expired tokens, or misconfigured SSH keys.

A frequent example is encountering a "Permission denied (publickey)" error when attempting to push to a remote repository using SSH. This usually indicates that your SSH key is not properly configured on your GitHub account or that the SSH agent is not running. Another common scenario involves using HTTPS and having your credentials cached incorrectly. For instance, after changing your GitHub password, Git might still be using the old credentials, leading to an "Authentication failed" error. Resolving these issues often involves updating your stored credentials, reconfiguring SSH keys, or using a credential helper to manage authentication securely.
