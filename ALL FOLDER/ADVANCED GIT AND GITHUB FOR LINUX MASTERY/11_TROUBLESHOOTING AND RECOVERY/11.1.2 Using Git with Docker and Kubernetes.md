This section explores how Git integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, two essential tools in modern software development and deployment. Git plays a crucial role in managing the source code used to build Docker images and defining the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations for Kubernetes deployments. By version controlling your Dockerfiles, application code, and Kubernetes manifests, you ensure reproducibility, traceability, and collaboration throughout the containerization lifecycle.

A common workflow involves storing your application code and Dockerfile in a Git repository. When a change is pushed to the repository, a CI/CD pipeline (often triggered by a Git hook) can automatically build a new Docker image based on the updated code. This image is then tagged and pushed to a container registry like Docker Hub or a private registry. Similarly, Kubernetes manifests (YAML files defining deployments, services, etc.) are also stored in Git. Tools like Flux or Argo CD can then monitor the Git repository for changes to these manifests and automatically apply them to the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that the deployed application reflects the desired state defined in Git.

For example, consider a simple Node.js application. The Git repository would contain the Node.js code, a `Dockerfile` to build the image, and a `deployment.yaml` file for Kubernetes. A change to the Node.js code would trigger a rebuild of the Docker image, and a change to the `deployment.yaml` file would trigger an update to the Kubernetes deployment. This Git-centric approach allows for automated and auditable deployments, making it easier to manage complex containerized applications.
