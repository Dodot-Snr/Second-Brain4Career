Debugging in Git often starts with understanding the history of changes. `git log` is your primary tool for this, allowing you to examine commit history, identify when changes were made, and by whom. Mastering `git log` is crucial for pinpointing the source of bugs, understanding the evolution of your codebase, and collaborating effectively. Beyond the basic usage, `git log` offers powerful options for filtering, formatting, and visualizing commit history.

Effective log analysis involves using flags to narrow down the information displayed. For example, `git log -p <filename>` shows the patch (diff) for each commit that modified the specified file, allowing you to see exactly what changes were made. Another useful option is `git log --author="Author Name"`, which filters the log to only show commits made by a specific author. Combining these flags, such as `git log -p --author="Author Name" <filename>`, provides a highly focused view of the changes made to a specific file by a particular author.

Understanding how to interpret the output of `git log` is just as important as knowing the commands. Pay attention to the commit hash (SHA-1), author, date, and commit message. The commit message should ideally provide a concise explanation of the changes made. By carefully analyzing this information, you can trace the origin of issues and gain a deeper understanding of your project's history.
