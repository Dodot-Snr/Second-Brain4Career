This section delves into the crucial aspects of managing container images, a fundamental skill for anyone working with containerization. We'll explore how to effectively build, store, share, and optimize container images using Git and GitHub in conjunction with container registries. Understanding these processes is essential for creating reproducible and scalable applications.

We'll cover topics such as creating Dockerfiles, building images using `docker build`, tagging images for version control, and pushing them to container registries like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). We'll also explore strategies for optimizing image size and security, including multi-stage builds and vulnerability scanning. For example, you might use a multi-stage build to compile your application in one stage and then copy only the necessary binaries to a smaller, more secure base image in a later stage.

A key example we'll examine is using GitHub Actions to automate the building and publishing of container images whenever changes are pushed to a specific branch in your Git repository. This allows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of your containerized applications, ensuring that your images are always up-to-date and readily available.

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build the Docker image
        run: docker build . -t ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/my-app:latest
      - name: Log in to GitHub Container Registry
        run: echo "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" | docker login ghcr.io -u ${{ github.actor }} --password-stdin
      - name: Push the Docker image
        run: docker push ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/my-app:latest
```
