Containerization is a lightweight virtualization method that packages an application with all its dependencies, such as libraries, system tools, code, and runtime, into a single, isolated unit called a container. Unlike virtual machines (VMs) which virtualize the entire hardware, containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient in terms of resource utilization and faster to start. This isolation ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, from development to testing to production, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.

A key benefit of containerization is its portability. You can easily move a container from one environment to another without worrying about compatibility issues. Docker is the most popular containerization platform, allowing you to define your application's environment in a `Dockerfile` and then build and run containers based on that definition. Another example is Podman, a daemonless container engine that offers similar functionality to Docker but with enhanced security features.

For example, you might containerize a web application written in Python with its specific version of Django and all its dependencies. This container can then be deployed on any server with a container runtime (like Docker or Podman) without needing to install or configure the Python environment on the host machine. This simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.
