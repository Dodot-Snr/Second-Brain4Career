Reverting commits is a crucial recovery technique in Git that allows you to undo the changes introduced by a specific commit _without_ altering the project's history. Unlike resetting, reverting creates a _new_ commit that effectively undoes the changes from the target commit. This is particularly useful when working collaboratively, as it avoids rewriting shared history, which can cause significant issues for other developers. Reverting is a safe and recommended approach for undoing changes that have already been pushed to a remote repository.

When you revert a commit, Git analyzes the changes introduced by that commit and creates a new commit that applies the _opposite_ changes. For example, if the original commit added a line of code, the reverting commit will remove that line. If the original commit deleted a file, the reverting commit will re-add the file. This ensures that the project's state is effectively rolled back to the state before the reverted commit was applied.

For example, to revert the most recent commit, you would use the command `git revert HEAD`. To revert a specific commit identified by its hash, you would use `git revert <commit-hash>`. Git will then open your configured text editor, allowing you to customize the commit message for the reverting commit before it is created. This provides an opportunity to explain why the revert is being performed.

```bash
git revert HEAD # Revert the last commit
git revert a1b2c3d4 # Revert a specific commit
```
