Merge conflicts are a common headache in collaborative Git workflows, arising when Git is unable to automatically reconcile changes from different branches being merged. This typically happens when multiple developers have modified the same lines in the same file, or when one developer has deleted a file that another has modified. Git flags these areas as conflicts, requiring manual intervention to resolve them.

When a merge conflict occurs, Git inserts special conflict markers into the affected file. These markers look something like `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch_name`. The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents the changes from your current branch (HEAD), while the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch_name` represents the changes from the branch you're merging in. For example, if two developers change the same line in `README.md`, a conflict will arise during the merge.

Resolving merge conflicts involves carefully examining the conflicting sections, deciding which changes to keep (or combining them), and then removing the conflict markers. After resolving all conflicts in a file, you stage the file (`git add`) and continue the merge process (`git commit`). Understanding how to identify, analyze, and resolve merge conflicts is crucial for effective collaboration and maintaining a clean and consistent codebase.
