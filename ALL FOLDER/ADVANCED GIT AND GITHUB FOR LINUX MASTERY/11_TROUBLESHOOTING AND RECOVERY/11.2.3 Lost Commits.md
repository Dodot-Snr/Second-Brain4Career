Losing commits in Git can be a frustrating experience, but it's often recoverable. This usually happens when you accidentally delete a branch, force push over existing commits, or your reflog gets pruned. Git's distributed nature and its powerful reflog (reference log) are your best friends in these situations. The reflog records updates to the tip of branches and other references, allowing you to see where your branches pointed at various times, even if those branches no longer exist.

A common scenario is accidentally deleting a branch containing important work. For example, you might have created a feature branch `feature/new-login` and made several commits, but then mistakenly deleted it with `git branch -d feature/new-login`. Another example is force pushing to a remote branch, overwriting the history with your local version, effectively "losing" the commits that were previously on the remote.

To recover from these situations, you can use `git reflog` to find the commit hashes of the lost commits. Once you've identified the commit, you can create a new branch pointing to that commit, effectively resurrecting your work. For instance, if `git reflog` shows a commit hash `a1b2c3d` that represents the tip of your deleted `feature/new-login` branch, you can create a new branch with `git branch feature/new-login-recovered a1b2c3d` to recover your work.
