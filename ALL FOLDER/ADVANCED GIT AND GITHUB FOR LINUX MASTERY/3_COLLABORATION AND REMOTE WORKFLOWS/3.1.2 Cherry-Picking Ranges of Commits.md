Beyond cherry-picking individual commits, Git allows you to cherry-pick a _range_ of commits. This is useful when you need to incorporate a series of related changes from one branch into another without merging the entire branch. Specifying a range involves using commit hashes to define the start and end points of the desired sequence.

To cherry-pick a range, you can use the `git cherry-pick <start-commit>^..<end-commit>` syntax. The `^` after the start commit excludes it from the range, while the `..<end-commit>` includes the end commit. For example, if you want to cherry-pick commits from `commitA` (exclusive) to `commitD` (inclusive), you would use: `git cherry-pick commitA^..commitD`. Alternatively, `git cherry-pick commitA..commitD` will include `commitA` in the cherry-picked range.

Be aware that cherry-picking ranges can sometimes lead to conflicts, especially if the changes in the range are heavily dependent on each other or if the target branch has diverged significantly. Resolve any conflicts as you would with a regular merge or cherry-pick. After resolving conflicts, use `git cherry-pick --continue` to proceed. If you want to abort the cherry-pick, use `git cherry-pick --abort`.
