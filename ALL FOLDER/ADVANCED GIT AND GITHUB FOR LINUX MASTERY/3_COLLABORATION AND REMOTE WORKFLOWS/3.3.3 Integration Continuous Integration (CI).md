Continuous Integration (CI) is a crucial practice for modern software development, especially when working with pull requests. By integrating CI into your pull request workflow, you can automatically validate code changes before they are merged into the main branch. This helps to catch bugs early, enforce coding standards, and ensure that new code doesn't break existing functionality. CI systems typically run automated tests, linters, and other checks whenever a new pull request is created or updated.

The core idea is to provide rapid feedback on the quality of the proposed changes. For example, a CI system might run unit tests to verify that individual functions are working correctly. It could also run integration tests to ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected. If any of these tests fail, the CI system will report the failure, preventing the pull request from being merged until the issues are resolved. This automated feedback loop significantly reduces the risk of introducing errors into the codebase.

A common example is using GitHub Actions to run tests on every pull request. You can define a workflow in a `.github/workflows` directory that specifies the steps to be executed, such as installing dependencies, running tests, and reporting the results. Another example is using a tool like `flake8` to automatically check for code style violations:

```yaml
name: Python CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python 3.9
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install flake8 pytest
      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: |
          flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: |
          pytest
```
