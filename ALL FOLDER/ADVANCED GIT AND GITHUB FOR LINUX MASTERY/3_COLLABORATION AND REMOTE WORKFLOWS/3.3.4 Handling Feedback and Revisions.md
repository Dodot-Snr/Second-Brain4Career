The pull request process isn't just about submitting code; it's a collaborative review process. Expect feedback! Handling feedback gracefully and efficiently is crucial for a smooth merge and demonstrates your commitment to quality. This involves understanding the feedback, addressing concerns, and revising your code accordingly. Remember to communicate clearly with reviewers, explaining your changes and rationale.

Revisions are an iterative part of the pull request workflow. After receiving feedback, you'll likely need to modify your code. Make these changes in your local branch, commit them with descriptive messages (e.g., "Fix: Address feedback on edge case handling"), and push them to your remote branch. These new commits will automatically appear in the pull request, updating the reviewers. For example, if a reviewer suggests simplifying a complex conditional statement, you would refactor the code, commit the change, and push it.

A common scenario involves addressing style issues. Let's say a reviewer points out inconsistent indentation. You would correct the indentation using your preferred editor or a tool like `clang-format`, commit the changes with a message like "Style: Correct indentation based on review," and push the updated branch. This iterative process ensures the final merged code adheres to project standards and best practices.
