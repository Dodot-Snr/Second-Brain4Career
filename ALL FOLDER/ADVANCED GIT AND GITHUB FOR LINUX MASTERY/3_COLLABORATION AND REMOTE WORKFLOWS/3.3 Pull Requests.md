Pull Requests (PRs) are the cornerstone of collaborative development on platforms like GitHub. They represent a proposal to merge changes from one branch (usually a feature branch) into another (typically the main or develop branch). A PR isn't just about merging code; it's a request for review and discussion. This process allows team members to examine the proposed changes, provide feedback, suggest improvements, and ensure the code adheres to project standards before integration.

The lifecycle of a pull request typically involves creating a branch, making changes, pushing the branch to a remote repository, and then opening a PR against the target branch. Reviewers can then add comments directly to specific lines of code, suggest alternative implementations, or request further modifications. Once the reviewers are satisfied and any necessary changes have been made, the PR can be merged. For example, imagine you've implemented a new feature in a branch called `feature/new-login`. You would open a PR targeting the `develop` branch to integrate your changes.

A key benefit of pull requests is the ability to automate checks and validations. Using GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tools, you can automatically run tests, linting, and security scans on the code within the PR. This ensures that only code that meets the project's quality standards is merged. For instance, a PR might trigger a build process that runs unit tests. If the tests fail, the PR is automatically flagged, preventing the merge until the issues are resolved.
