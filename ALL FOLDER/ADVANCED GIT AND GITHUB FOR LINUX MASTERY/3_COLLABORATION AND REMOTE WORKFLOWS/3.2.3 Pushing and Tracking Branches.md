Pushing and tracking branches are essential skills for collaborative development using Git and GitHub. Pushing involves uploading your local branch to a remote repository, making your changes available to others. Tracking, on the other hand, establishes a connection between your local branch and a remote branch, simplifying future push and pull operations. Understanding these concepts allows you to efficiently share your work and stay synchronized with the remote repository.

When you create a new branch locally and want to share it, you use `git push -u origin <branch_name>`. The `-u` flag sets up tracking, so subsequent pushes and pulls on that branch can be done simply with `git push` and `git pull`. Without tracking, Git wouldn't know which remote branch your local branch corresponds to. For example, if you're working on a feature called "new-feature", you'd use `git push -u origin new-feature` to push it to the `origin` remote and set up tracking.

Tracking also simplifies collaboration. If someone else has pushed changes to the remote "new-feature" branch, you can easily update your local branch with `git pull`. Git knows to fetch the changes from the tracked remote branch. If you're working on a team, understanding how to properly push and track branches is crucial for avoiding conflicts and ensuring everyone is working with the latest code.
