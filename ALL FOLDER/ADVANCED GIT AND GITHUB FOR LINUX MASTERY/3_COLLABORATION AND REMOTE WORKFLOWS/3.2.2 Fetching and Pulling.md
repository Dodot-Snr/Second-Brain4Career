Fetching and pulling are essential operations for synchronizing your local Git repository with remote repositories. While both update your local repository with changes from a remote, they differ in how they integrate those changes. Fetching retrieves the latest changes from the remote but _doesn't_ automatically merge them into your local branches. This allows you to review the changes before integrating them. Pulling, on the other hand, is essentially a fetch followed by a merge (or rebase, depending on your configuration).

The `git fetch` command downloads objects and refs from another repository. For example, `git fetch origin` will retrieve all new commits, branches, and tags from the `origin` remote. You can then inspect these changes using commands like `git log origin/main` to see the changes on the remote `main` branch. To integrate these changes, you would then use `git merge origin/main` or `git rebase origin/main`.

The `git pull` command is a convenience command that combines fetching and merging. For example, `git pull origin main` will fetch the latest changes from the `main` branch of the `origin` remote and then attempt to merge them into your current branch. While convenient, it's important to understand the underlying fetch and merge operations to handle potential conflicts effectively. Using `git pull --rebase origin main` will fetch and then rebase your current branch onto the remote `main` branch.
