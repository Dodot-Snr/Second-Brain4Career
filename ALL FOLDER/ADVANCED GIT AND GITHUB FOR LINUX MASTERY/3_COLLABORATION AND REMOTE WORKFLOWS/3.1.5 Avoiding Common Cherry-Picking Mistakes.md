Cherry-picking, while powerful, can introduce subtle bugs and inconsistencies if not handled carefully. A common mistake is cherry-picking commits that rely on other commits not yet present in the target branch. This can lead to broken builds or unexpected behavior. Always ensure the cherry-picked commit has all its dependencies satisfied in the target branch. For example, if commit `B` introduces a function call that is defined in commit `A`, you must cherry-pick `A` before `B`, or cherry-pick both together.

Another frequent error is cherry-picking merge commits. Git struggles to automatically resolve conflicts in merge commits during cherry-picking, as it doesn't know which parent to choose. It's generally best to avoid cherry-picking merge commits altogether. If you must incorporate changes from a merge commit, consider cherry-picking the individual commits that were merged instead. For instance, instead of cherry-picking a merge commit that combined features A and B, cherry-pick the individual commits that implemented feature A and feature B separately.

Finally, remember to thoroughly test after cherry-picking. Even if the cherry-pick appears successful, subtle differences in the target branch's context can lead to unexpected issues. Always run your test suite and manually verify the changes to ensure everything works as expected.
