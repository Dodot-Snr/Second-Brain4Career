Pull Requests (PRs) are the cornerstone of collaborative development on platforms like GitHub. They represent a proposed change to a codebase, allowing for discussion, review, and automated testing before integration. Creating a PR involves branching from the main branch (usually `main` or `master`), making your changes, pushing the branch to a remote repository, and then initiating a PR through the GitHub interface. This signals to the project maintainers that you have a contribution ready for consideration.

The review process is equally crucial. Reviewers examine the code for correctness, style, potential bugs, and adherence to project standards. They can leave comments directly on specific lines of code, suggest changes, and ultimately approve or reject the PR. This iterative process ensures code quality and knowledge sharing within the team. For example, a reviewer might suggest refactoring a complex function into smaller, more manageable units or point out a potential security vulnerability.

Consider a scenario where you've added a new feature to a Linux utility. You'd create a branch, implement the feature, and then open a PR. A reviewer might then suggest improvements to the user interface or point out a potential conflict with existing functionality. Another example is fixing a bug. You'd create a branch, fix the bug, and then open a PR. A reviewer might then suggest a better way to fix the bug or point out that the fix introduces a new bug.
