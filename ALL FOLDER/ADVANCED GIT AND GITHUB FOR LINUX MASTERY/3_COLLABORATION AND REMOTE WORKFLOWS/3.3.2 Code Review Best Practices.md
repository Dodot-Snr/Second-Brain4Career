Code review is a critical part of the pull request process, ensuring code quality, knowledge sharing, and bug detection. Effective code reviews go beyond simply checking for errors; they involve understanding the code's purpose, its impact on the system, and its adherence to coding standards. A good code review process helps maintain a consistent codebase and reduces the likelihood of introducing regressions or security vulnerabilities.

Key best practices include focusing on code clarity, maintainability, and testability. Reviewers should provide constructive feedback, explaining the reasoning behind their suggestions. For example, instead of saying "This code is bad," a reviewer might say, "Consider using a more descriptive variable name here, as it's not immediately clear what `temp` represents. This will improve readability for future maintainers." Another example is suggesting the addition of unit tests to cover edge cases or complex logic.

Ultimately, the goal of code review is to improve the overall quality of the software and foster a collaborative environment where developers learn from each other. Remember to be respectful and focus on the code, not the author.
