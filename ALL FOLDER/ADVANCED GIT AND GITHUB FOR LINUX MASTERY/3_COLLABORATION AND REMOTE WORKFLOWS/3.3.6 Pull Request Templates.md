Pull Request (PR) templates are pre-defined markdown files that automatically populate the body of a new pull request on GitHub. They provide a standardized structure for contributors to describe their changes, ensuring that all necessary information is included for reviewers. This promotes consistency, clarity, and efficiency in the code review process. Using PR templates helps streamline collaboration and reduces back-and-forth communication by prompting contributors to address key aspects of their changes upfront.

A typical PR template might include sections for: a brief description of the changes, the motivation behind the changes (e.g., bug fix, new feature), a list of changes made, how the changes were tested, and any potential risks or areas of concern. For example, a template for a bug fix might ask the contributor to describe the bug, how they reproduced it, and how their changes address the issue. A template for a new feature might ask for a description of the feature, its intended use, and any relevant documentation updates.

To create a PR template, simply create a file named `.github/pull_request_template.md` in your repository's root directory. You can also create multiple templates and store them in the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` directory. GitHub will then present users with a choice of templates when creating a new pull request. Here's a simple example:

```markdown
## Description
