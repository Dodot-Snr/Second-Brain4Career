The `update` hook is a powerful server-side Git hook that runs _before_ any updates are made to the repository. Specifically, it's executed once for each branch being pushed to the server. This hook receives three arguments: the name of the branch being updated, the old object name (SHA-1) stored in the branch, and the new object name (SHA-1) being pushed. This allows you to inspect the changes being made and reject the push if it doesn't meet your criteria.

Unlike the `pre-receive` hook, which runs only once for the entire push, the `update` hook provides granular control at the branch level. This makes it ideal for enforcing branch-specific policies. For example, you could use it to prevent direct commits to the `main` branch, forcing developers to use pull requests. Or, you could check if the commit message adheres to a specific format before allowing the update.

Here's a simple example of an `update` hook that prevents force pushes to the `main` branch:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

branch="$1"
old_sha="$2"
new_sha="$3"

if [[ "$branch" == "refs/heads/main" ]] && git rev-list "$old_sha..$new_sha" --count --reverse > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Error: Force pushes to main branch are not allowed." >&2
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

This script checks if the branch being updated is `main` and if the push is a force push (indicated by the `git rev-list` command returning a non-zero exit code). If both conditions are true, it rejects the push.
