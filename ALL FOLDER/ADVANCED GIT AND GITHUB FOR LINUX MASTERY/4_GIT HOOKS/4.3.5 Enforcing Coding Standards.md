Maintaining consistent coding standards across a project is crucial for readability, maintainability, and collaboration. Server-side hooks provide a powerful mechanism to automatically enforce these standards before code is integrated into the main codebase. By implementing checks within hooks like `pre-receive` or `update`, you can reject commits that don't adhere to predefined rules, ensuring a higher quality and more uniform codebase. This proactive approach prevents developers from accidentally introducing code that violates the established style guidelines.

These hooks can be configured to run various checks, such as verifying code formatting, enforcing naming conventions, and preventing the introduction of security vulnerabilities. For example, you could use a linter like `flake8` for Python or `eslint` for JavaScript within a `pre-receive` hook. If the linter detects any violations, the hook can reject the commit, providing feedback to the developer to correct the issues before pushing the code. Another example is checking for prohibited keywords or functions within the code, preventing the introduction of potentially harmful code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-receive hook example to check for 'TODO' comments
while read oldrev newrev refname; do
  git rev-list $oldrev..$newrev | while read commit; do
    if git show $commit | grep -q "TODO"; then
      echo "ERROR: Commit $commit contains 'TODO' comments. Please address them before pushing." >&2
      exit 1
    fi
  done
done
exit 0
```
