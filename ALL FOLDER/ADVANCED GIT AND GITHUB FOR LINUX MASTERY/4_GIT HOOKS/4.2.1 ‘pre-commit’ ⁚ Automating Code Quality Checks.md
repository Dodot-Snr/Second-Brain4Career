The `pre-commit` framework is a powerful tool for automating code quality checks before you even commit your code. It allows you to define a series of hooks that run against your staged changes, ensuring that your code adheres to specific style guidelines, security best practices, and other project-specific requirements. By catching issues early, `pre-commit` helps maintain a consistent codebase and reduces the burden on code reviewers. It's configured using a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your repository's root directory.

`pre-commit` supports a wide range of hooks, from simple linters like `flake8` for Python or `eslint` for JavaScript, to more complex tools like `terraform fmt` for Terraform code formatting. You can also create custom hooks to enforce project-specific rules. For example, you might use a custom hook to prevent committing files with certain keywords or to ensure that all commit messages follow a specific format.

Here's a simple example of a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file that uses `black` for Python code formatting and `flake8` for linting:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.12.1  # Use the revision you want
    hooks:
    -   id: black
-   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 6.1.0  # Use the revision you want
    hooks:
    -   id: flake8
```

With this configuration, running `pre-commit run` will automatically format your Python code with `black` and check it for linting errors with `flake8` before allowing you to commit.
