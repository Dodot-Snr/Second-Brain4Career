The `pre-rebase` hook is a client-side Git hook that executes _before_ a `git rebase` operation begins. This hook allows you to inspect the changes that are about to be rebased and potentially prevent the rebase from occurring if certain conditions aren't met. It's a powerful tool for enforcing coding standards, preventing sensitive data from being rebased onto a public branch, or ensuring that the rebase won't introduce conflicts that you're not prepared to handle. The hook receives two arguments: the upstream branch and the branch being rebased.

A common use case for the `pre-rebase` hook is to prevent rebasing onto a protected branch, such as `main` or `develop`, directly. This can help maintain a clean and linear history on those branches. For example, you might want to ensure that all changes are reviewed via a pull request before being integrated. Another example is to check for large files or sensitive information (like API keys) that should not be committed to the repository.

Here's a simple example of a `pre-rebase` hook (placed in `.git/hooks/pre-rebase`):

```bash
#!/bin/sh

upstream="$1"
branch="$2"

if [ "$upstream" = "origin/main" ]; then
  echo "Rebasing onto origin/main is not allowed.  Please use a pull request."
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

This script checks if the upstream branch is `origin/main`. If it is, the script prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status code, preventing the rebase from proceeding. Otherwise, it exits with a zero status code, allowing the rebase to continue. Remember to make the script executable (`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-rebase`).
