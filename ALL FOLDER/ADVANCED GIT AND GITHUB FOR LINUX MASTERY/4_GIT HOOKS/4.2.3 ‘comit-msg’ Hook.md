The `commit-msg` hook is a powerful client-side Git hook that allows you to inspect and modify the commit message _before_ the commit is finalized. This hook is executed after the user has entered a commit message but before the commit is actually created. It receives the name of a temporary file containing the commit message as its only argument. You can then read, modify, and save the commit message back to the file. This makes it ideal for enforcing commit message standards, adding issue tracker references, or automatically correcting common typos.

A common use case for the `commit-msg` hook is to ensure that all commit messages adhere to a specific format, such as including a ticket number from a project management system. For example, you could write a script that checks if the commit message starts with a valid ticket number (e.g., "JIRA-123: Fix bug in user authentication"). If the ticket number is missing or invalid, the script can either reject the commit or automatically prepend the correct ticket number based on some logic.

Another example is automatically adding a "Signed-off-by:" line to the commit message, which is often required in open-source projects. The script could read the user's email address from the Git configuration and append the "Signed-off-by:" line to the commit message file. This ensures that all commits are properly attributed and comply with the project's contribution guidelines.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Example: Add "Signed-off-by:" line to commit message

EMAIL=$(git config user.email)
echo "Signed-off-by: $(git config user.name) <$EMAIL>" >> "$1"
```
