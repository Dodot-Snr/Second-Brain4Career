Once you've created your custom hooks, effectively managing and configuring them is crucial for maintaining a clean and efficient Git workflow. This involves understanding where hooks reside, how to make them executable, and how to configure them to run under specific conditions. The `.git/hooks` directory is where all hook scripts are stored. Remember that Git doesn't automatically execute scripts placed in this directory; they must be made executable using `chmod +x <hook_name>`.

Configuration often involves setting environment variables or passing arguments to your hook scripts. For example, you might want to configure a `pre-commit` hook to only run specific linters based on the files being committed. This could be achieved by checking the staged files against a configuration file. Another common scenario is using environment variables to control the verbosity or behavior of your hooks, allowing you to easily toggle debugging information or enable/disable certain checks.

For example, to make a `pre-commit` hook executable, you would run:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

And to pass arguments to a hook, you can simply include them in the commit message or use environment variables:

```bash
# Example using environment variables
export LINT_LEVEL="strict"
git commit -m "Fix: Some changes"
```

Your `pre-commit` hook can then access the `LINT_LEVEL` environment variable to adjust its behavior.
