The `pre-receive` hook is a powerful server-side Git hook that runs before any references are updated on the remote repository. This hook is executed once for each push operation, receiving a list of references that are being updated. Each line in the input to the hook contains the old object name, the new object name, and the name of the reference being updated. This allows you to inspect the changes being pushed and reject the entire push if it doesn't meet your criteria. It's a crucial tool for enforcing repository policies and maintaining code quality.

Unlike client-side hooks, `pre-receive` runs on the server, making it a reliable way to enforce rules that cannot be bypassed by individual developers. Common uses include preventing pushes of large files, enforcing commit message formats, and restricting who can update specific branches. If the `pre-receive` script exits with a non-zero status, the entire push is rejected, and an error message is displayed to the user.

For example, you could create a `pre-receive` hook that checks if any commits being pushed contain the word "FIXME". If found, the push is rejected. Another example is preventing direct pushes to the `main` branch, forcing developers to use pull requests. The following bash script snippet demonstrates how to prevent pushes to the `main` branch:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while read oldrev newrev refname; do
  if [[ $refname == refs/heads/main ]]; then
    echo "Direct pushes to main are not allowed. Please use pull requests." >&2
    exit 1
  fi
done

exit 0
```
