The `post-rewrite` hook is a client-side hook that runs after Git commands that rewrite commits, such as `git commit --amend`, `git rebase`, and `git filter-branch`. This hook is useful for performing actions after the commit history has been modified, such as updating related files or notifying other systems about the changes. Unlike `pre-rewrite`, this hook runs _after_ the rewrite has already occurred, allowing you to react to the new state of the repository.

The `post-rewrite` hook receives two arguments: the command that triggered the rewrite (e.g., "rebase", "commit") and a list of the original and rewritten object names. This information can be used to determine the specific changes that were made and to take appropriate action. For example, you could use this hook to update a changelog file with the new commit messages or to trigger a build process based on the rewritten history.

Example: Suppose you want to update a file containing a list of commit hashes whenever a rebase occurs. Your `post-rewrite` hook (located at `.git/hooks/post-rewrite`) might look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
command="$1"
old_sha1="$2"
new_sha1="$3"

if [ "$command" = "rebase" ]; then
  # Update the commit hash list file
  echo "Rebase detected, updating commit hash list..."
  git log --pretty=format:"%H" > commit_hashes.txt
fi
```

This script checks if the rewrite command was `rebase`. If so, it updates a file named `commit_hashes.txt` with the latest commit hashes from the repository.
