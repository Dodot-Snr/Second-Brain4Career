Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are a powerful mechanism for automating and customizing your Git workflow. Think of them as triggers that fire off specific actions based on Git events. These hooks reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository and are initially provided as example scripts. To activate a hook, simply remove the `.sample` extension.

Hooks can be used for a wide range of tasks, from enforcing coding standards and running tests before commits to notifying team members of new pushes. For example, a `pre-commit` hook could run a linter to check for syntax errors and style violations, preventing commits that don't meet the project's standards. Another common use case is a `pre-push` hook that executes unit tests, ensuring that only code that passes all tests is pushed to the remote repository.

Here's a simple example of a `pre-commit` hook (written in bash) that prevents commits with the word "TODO" in them:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | grep -q '\.txt$'; then
  if git diff --cached | grep -q "TODO"; then
    echo "Aborting commit: Found 'TODO' in the commit."
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

This script checks if any `.txt` files are being committed and, if so, searches for the string "TODO". If found, the commit is aborted.
