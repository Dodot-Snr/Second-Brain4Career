Client-side hooks are scripts that Git executes automatically before or after certain events on the client-side, such as committing, merging, or pushing. They allow you to customize your Git workflow and enforce specific rules or checks before changes are integrated into the repository. These hooks reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of your local repository and are specific to that repository. They are not automatically shared with other users when the repository is cloned.

Client-side hooks are useful for tasks like: checking commit messages for proper formatting, running linters or code formatters before committing, preventing commits that introduce specific errors, or automatically updating files based on changes. They can be written in any scripting language, such as Bash, Python, or Perl, as long as the script is executable.

For example, a `pre-commit` hook could be used to ensure that all staged files pass a code style check before allowing the commit to proceed. Another example is a `commit-msg` hook that validates the commit message against a predefined pattern.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# A simple pre-commit hook to check for trailing whitespace

if git diff --cached --check --exit-code; then
  echo "No trailing whitespace detected."
  exit 0
else
  echo "Trailing whitespace detected. Please remove it before committing."
  exit 1
fi
