Server-side hooks are powerful scripts that run on the Git server before or after certain Git events, such as receiving a push. They allow you to enforce policies, automate workflows, and integrate Git with other systems. Unlike client-side hooks, which are specific to a user's local repository, server-side hooks affect all users interacting with the central repository. This makes them ideal for maintaining code quality, security, and compliance across the entire project.

These hooks are typically written in scripting languages like Bash or Python and reside in the `hooks` directory of the Git repository on the server (e.g., `.git/hooks`). Common use cases include preventing commits with bad commit messages (using `pre-receive`), running automated tests after a push (using `post-receive`), or deploying code to a staging environment upon a successful merge to the main branch.

For example, a `pre-receive` hook could check if a commit message adheres to a specific format, rejecting the push if it doesn't. Another example is a `post-receive` hook that triggers a build and deployment process after a successful push to the `main` branch. This automation ensures that the latest code is always deployed to the appropriate environment.
