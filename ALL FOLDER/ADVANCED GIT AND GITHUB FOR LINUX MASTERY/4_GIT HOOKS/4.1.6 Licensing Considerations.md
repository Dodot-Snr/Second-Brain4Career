When forking and contributing to open-source projects, understanding licensing is paramount. Licenses dictate how you can use, modify, and distribute the software. Ignoring a project's license can lead to legal issues and ethical concerns. Before contributing, carefully review the project's license file (often named `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt` in the repository root). Pay attention to the permissions and restrictions it grants, especially regarding redistribution and modification.

Common open-source licenses include the MIT License, Apache 2.0 License, and GNU General Public License (GPL). The MIT License is permissive, allowing almost any use as long as the original copyright notice is included. The Apache 2.0 License is similar but also includes a patent grant. The GPL is more restrictive, requiring that any derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. For example, if you fork a project licensed under GPLv3 and modify it, your modified version must also be licensed under GPLv3. Understanding these differences is crucial for ensuring your contributions comply with the project's licensing terms.
