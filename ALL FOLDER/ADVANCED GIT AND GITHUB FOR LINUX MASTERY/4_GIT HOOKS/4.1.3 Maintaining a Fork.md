Once you've forked a repository, the original (upstream) repository will likely continue to evolve. Maintaining your fork involves keeping it synchronized with these upstream changes. This ensures you're working with the latest code and can contribute effectively. The primary method for this is by configuring a remote pointing to the upstream repository and then fetching and merging changes from it.

To keep your fork up-to-date, you'll first add the upstream repository as a remote. Assuming the upstream repository is at `https://github.com/original/repo`, you would use the following command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo
```

After adding the remote, you can fetch the upstream changes:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Finally, merge the changes into your local `main` branch (or whichever branch you're working on):

```bash
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

Alternatively, you can rebase your branch on top of the upstream branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main
```

Rebasing keeps your commit history cleaner, but requires force-pushing if you've already pushed your branch to your fork. Choose the method that best suits your workflow and the project's contribution guidelines. Regularly maintaining your fork ensures smoother contributions and avoids potential conflicts.
