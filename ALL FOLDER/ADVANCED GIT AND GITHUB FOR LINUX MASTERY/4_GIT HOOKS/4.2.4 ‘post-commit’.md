The `post-commit` hook executes immediately after a successful `git commit` command. Unlike the `pre-commit` hook, which can prevent a commit from happening, `post-commit` runs after the commit is already finalized. This makes it ideal for tasks that need to occur after a commit, such as sending notifications, updating indexes, or triggering builds. Because the commit has already happened, failures in `post-commit` won't prevent the commit itself, but they should be handled gracefully to avoid confusing the user.

A common use case for `post-commit` is to notify team members about new commits. For example, you could write a script that sends an email or posts a message to a Slack channel whenever a commit is made to a specific branch. Another example is updating a local index or cache based on the changes introduced by the commit.

Here's a simple example of a `post-commit` script that echoes a message to the console after each commit:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Commit completed successfully!"
```

Remember to make the script executable using `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit`. While simple, this demonstrates the basic functionality. More complex scripts can leverage `git log -1 HEAD` to inspect the details of the most recent commit and perform actions accordingly.
