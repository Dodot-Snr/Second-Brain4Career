Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. Custom hooks allow you to automate and customize your Git workflow by running custom scripts at specific points in the Git lifecycle. They reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository and are named according to the event they trigger (e.g., `pre-commit`, `post-receive`). These scripts can be written in any scripting language, such as Bash, Python, or Perl, as long as they are executable.

Custom hooks are powerful tools for enforcing coding standards, running tests, and automating deployment tasks. For example, a `pre-commit` hook could run linters to check for code style violations before allowing a commit. A `post-receive` hook could automatically deploy changes to a staging server after a successful push to the remote repository. By leveraging custom hooks, you can ensure code quality, streamline development processes, and maintain consistency across your projects.

Here's a simple example of a `pre-commit` hook written in Bash that prevents commits with the word "TODO" in them:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | xargs grep -q TODO; then
  echo "Error: Commit contains 'TODO'. Please remove before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```

Another example is a `post-receive` hook that automatically deploys changes to a web server:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while read oldrev newrev ref
do
  if [[ $ref =~ refs/heads/master$ ]]; then
    echo "Master branch was updated. Deploying..."
    cd /var/www/mywebsite
    git pull origin master
    # Add any other deployment commands here (e.g., restart web server)
  fi
done
```
