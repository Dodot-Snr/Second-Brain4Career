The `post-receive` hook is a powerful server-side Git hook that executes _after_ the entire push operation has been completed and all refs have been updated. This makes it ideal for tasks that need to occur after a successful push, such as deploying code to a production server, sending notifications, or updating a project's issue tracker. Unlike `pre-receive`, `post-receive` cannot prevent the push from succeeding, as it runs after the fact.

A common use case for `post-receive` is to trigger a deployment process. For example, you might have a script that checks out the latest version of the code into a web server's document root. Another example is sending email notifications to team members about the successful push. The hook receives information about the refs that were updated, allowing you to tailor your actions based on the specific branches or tags that were pushed.

For example, a simple `post-receive` hook to print the updated refs could look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while read oldrev newrev refname; do
  echo "Ref $refname was updated."
  echo "Old revision: $oldrev"
  echo "New revision: $newrev"
done
```
