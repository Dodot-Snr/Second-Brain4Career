Server-side hooks provide a powerful mechanism for enforcing access control policies within your Git repository. By strategically placing hooks, you can restrict who can push specific branches, prevent the introduction of certain types of code, or ensure that commits meet specific criteria before being accepted. This is crucial for maintaining code quality, security, and compliance, especially in collaborative environments.

Implementing access control often involves using the `pre-receive` and `update` hooks. The `pre-receive` hook runs before any references are updated, allowing you to reject entire pushes based on the user or the branches being modified. The `update` hook runs once for each branch being updated, providing more granular control over individual commits. For example, you could use a `pre-receive` hook to prevent unauthorized users from pushing directly to the `main` branch, forcing them to use pull requests.

Consider a scenario where you want to restrict direct pushes to the `production` branch. You could implement a `pre-receive` hook that checks the user attempting the push and rejects the push if they are not on an approved list. Another example is using the `update` hook to verify that all commits pushed to a specific branch have been signed with a GPG key, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# pre-receive hook example: Prevent direct pushes to production

while read oldrev newrev refname
do
  branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $refname)
  user=$(git config user.email)

  if [[ "$branch" == "production" ]]; then
    if [[ "$user" != "approved_user@example.com" ]]; then
      echo "ERROR: Direct pushes to production are not allowed. Use a pull request." >&2
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
done

exit 0
```
