Now that you understand the different types of Git hooks and where they reside, it's time to learn how to write them. Git hooks are essentially scripts that Git executes before or after events like commit, push, and receive. You can write these scripts in any scripting language available on your system, such as Shell Script, Python, Ruby, or Perl. The key is to ensure the script is executable and placed in the `.git/hooks` directory.

The power of custom hooks lies in their ability to automate tasks, enforce policies, and integrate with other tools. For example, you could write a `pre-commit` hook in Shell Script to check for common coding style violations before allowing a commit. Or, you could use a Python script in a `pre-push` hook to run unit tests and prevent pushing code that fails these tests.

Here's a simple example of a `pre-commit` hook written in Shell Script that prevents commits with the string "TODO" in them:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | xargs grep -q TODO
then
  echo "Aborting commit: Found 'TODO' in staged changes."
  exit 1
fi
```

This script uses `git diff` to check the staged changes for the string "TODO". If found, it aborts the commit and displays a message. Similarly, you could write a Python script to check for syntax errors or other code quality issues. The possibilities are endless, limited only by your scripting skills and the needs of your project.
