Forking a repository on GitHub is the process of creating a personal copy of someone else's project under your own account. This allows you to freely experiment with changes, add features, or fix bugs without directly affecting the original project. It's a crucial step in contributing to open-source projects and a safe way to learn and modify existing codebases. Think of it as creating your own branch of development that you fully control.

The primary use case for forking is to contribute to projects where you don't have direct write access. For example, if you find a bug in a popular Linux utility hosted on GitHub, you would fork the repository, fix the bug in your forked copy, and then submit a "pull request" to the original project maintainers. This pull request proposes your changes for inclusion in the main project. Another example is using a forked repository as a starting point for your own project. You might fork a template repository or a library that provides a base functionality you want to extend.

To fork a repository, you simply navigate to the repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner. GitHub will then create a copy of the repository under your account. You can then clone this forked repository to your local machine, make your changes, and push them back to your forked repository on GitHub.
