Custom Git hooks offer powerful automation, but debugging them can be tricky. Since hooks execute silently in the background, errors might not be immediately obvious. Effective debugging involves strategic logging and understanding how Git interacts with your hook scripts. A common approach is to redirect output to a file or use a dedicated logging tool.

To debug, start by adding `echo` statements to your hook script to track its execution flow and variable values. For example, in a `pre-commit` hook, you might add `echo "Running pre-commit hook..." > /tmp/git_hook_log.txt` at the beginning and `echo "Commit message: $(git log -1 --pretty=%B)" >> /tmp/git_hook_log.txt` to inspect the commit message. Remember to make the hook executable (`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`).

Another useful technique is to temporarily disable the hook by renaming it (e.g., `pre-commit` to `pre-commit.disabled`) to isolate whether an issue stems from the hook itself. You can also use `set -x` at the beginning of your script to enable shell tracing, which will print each command as it's executed, providing detailed insight into the script's behavior.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
set -x
echo "Running pre-commit hook..." > /tmp/git_hook_log.txt
# Your hook logic here
```
