As a repository evolves, it accumulates commits, branches, and potentially large files. Over time, this can lead to a bloated repository, impacting performance and storage space. Compacting the repository involves techniques to reduce its size and improve efficiency without losing essential data. This is a crucial aspect of repository size management, especially for long-lived projects or those with a history of large file commits.

One common method for compacting a repository is using `git gc` (garbage collection). This command performs several optimizations, including packing loose objects into packfiles, pruning unreachable objects, and generally cleaning up the repository's internal structure. For example, running `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` will aggressively prune unreachable objects and optimize the packfiles. Another technique involves rewriting history to remove large files that were mistakenly committed. Tools like `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` can be used to surgically remove these files from the entire commit history, significantly reducing the repository size. However, rewriting history should be done with caution, as it can affect collaborators who have already based their work on the existing history.

```bash
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

```bash
git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 10M
```
