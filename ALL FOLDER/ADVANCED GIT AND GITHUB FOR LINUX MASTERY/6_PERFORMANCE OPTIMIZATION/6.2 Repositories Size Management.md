Large Git repositories can significantly impact performance, slowing down cloning, fetching, and other operations. Effective repository size management is crucial for maintaining a responsive and efficient development workflow. This involves identifying and mitigating factors that contribute to excessive repository size, such as large binary files, unnecessary history, and accumulated build artifacts.

Strategies for managing repository size include using `.gitignore` to prevent large or irrelevant files from being tracked, employing Git Large File Storage (LFS) for managing large binary assets like images and videos, and rewriting history to remove or filter out unwanted files or commits. For example, if you accidentally committed a large `node_modules` folder, you can use `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` to remove it from the entire history.

Another common scenario is dealing with large binary files that were committed in the past. Using Git LFS for these files and rewriting history to replace the original files with LFS pointers can dramatically reduce the repository size. This ensures that only the necessary versions of these large files are downloaded when needed, rather than bloating the entire repository history.
