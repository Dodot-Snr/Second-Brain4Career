The Git LFS workflow revolves around tracking large files in your Git repository without bloating the repository itself. Instead of storing the actual large files directly in Git, LFS stores pointers to these files. The actual file content is stored on a separate LFS server (like GitHub's LFS service). This keeps your repository lean and efficient, especially when dealing with large binary files like audio, video, datasets, or graphics.

The typical workflow involves first installing Git LFS and then tracking the desired file types using the `git lfs track` command. This command modifies the `.gitattributes` file, telling Git LFS to handle files matching the specified patterns. After tracking, you commit and push your changes as usual. Git LFS automatically handles the transfer of the large files to the LFS server in the background. When other users clone or pull the repository, Git LFS automatically downloads the large files they need.

For example, if you're working on a game development project, you might track all `.psd` (Photoshop) files using `git lfs track "*.psd"`. This ensures that large texture files are managed by LFS. Similarly, for a data science project, you might track large datasets in `.csv` format using `git lfs track "*.csv"`. This prevents the repository from becoming excessively large and slow due to the inclusion of these large data files.
