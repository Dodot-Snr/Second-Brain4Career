Git is excellent for tracking changes in text-based files, but it struggles with large binary files like audio, video, datasets, and graphics. Storing these directly in your Git repository can lead to performance issues, increased repository size, and slow cloning times. This is where Git LFS comes in. Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an open-source Git extension that replaces large files in your repository with text pointers, while storing the actual file content on a separate server.

Instead of storing the large file directly in the Git repository, Git LFS stores a pointer file. This pointer file is a small text file that contains information about the actual large file, such as its size and SHA-256 hash. When you clone the repository, Git downloads the pointer files. When you need the actual large file, Git LFS automatically downloads it from the LFS server. This keeps your Git repository lean and efficient, while still allowing you to track changes to large files.

For example, if you're working on a game development project, you might have large texture files or audio assets. Using Git LFS, you can track these files without bloating your repository. Similarly, data scientists working with large datasets can use Git LFS to version control their data without impacting Git performance.
