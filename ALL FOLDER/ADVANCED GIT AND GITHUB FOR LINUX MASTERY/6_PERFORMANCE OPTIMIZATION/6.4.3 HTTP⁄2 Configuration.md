HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol, designed to improve web performance by enabling features like multiplexing, header compression (HPACK), and server push. Configuring HTTP/2 on your Linux server is crucial for optimizing the delivery of your Git repositories and web-based Git interfaces like GitLab or GitHub Enterprise. This configuration typically involves enabling HTTP/2 within your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) and ensuring your server supports TLS/SSL, as most browsers require HTTPS for HTTP/2.

The configuration process varies depending on your web server. For example, in Nginx, you would add the `http2` parameter to the `listen` directive within your server block:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;

    # ... other configurations ...
}
```

Similarly, in Apache, you would enable the `http2` module and configure your virtual host to use it. Proper configuration ensures faster loading times for web-based Git interfaces, leading to a smoother user experience when interacting with your repositories through a browser. It also reduces server load by optimizing resource utilization.
