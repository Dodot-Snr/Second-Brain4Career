Git LFS (Large File Storage) is a Git extension designed to handle large files, such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics, which are not efficiently managed by Git's core architecture. Instead of storing the actual file content directly in the Git repository, Git LFS stores pointers to these files. The actual file content is stored on a separate LFS server, reducing the size of the Git repository and improving cloning and fetching speeds. This is crucial for projects dealing with large binary files that would otherwise bloat the repository and slow down operations.

Using Git LFS involves tracking specific file types or patterns. For example, you might track all `.psd` (Photoshop) files in your project. When you commit a file tracked by LFS, Git replaces the file with a small pointer file. When you checkout a commit, Git LFS automatically downloads the actual file content from the LFS server. This process is transparent to the user, making it easy to integrate into existing Git workflows.

For example, to start using Git LFS, you would first initialize it in your repository using `git lfs install`. Then, you would track the desired file types, such as `git lfs track "*.psd"`. After that, you add and commit the changes as usual: `git add .gitattributes` and `git commit -m "Track PSD files with Git LFS"`. This ensures that all `.psd` files are managed by Git LFS, keeping your repository lean and efficient.
