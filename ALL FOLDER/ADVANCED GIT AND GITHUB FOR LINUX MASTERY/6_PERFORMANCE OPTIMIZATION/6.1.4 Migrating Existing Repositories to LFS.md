Migrating an existing Git repository to use Git LFS involves tracking large files that were previously managed directly within the Git history. This process is crucial for improving repository performance and reducing its overall size. The migration involves identifying large files, configuring LFS to track them, and then rewriting the Git history to replace the actual file content with LFS pointers. This ensures that only pointers are stored in the Git history, while the large file content is stored separately on the LFS server.

The migration process typically involves using the `git lfs migrate` command. For example, to migrate all `.psd` and `.zip` files that are larger than 10MB, you would use: `git lfs migrate import --everything --above=10MB --include="*.psd,*.zip"`. This command rewrites the Git history, replacing the large files with LFS pointers. After the migration, you'll need to push the LFS objects to the LFS server using `git lfs push origin --all`. Finally, you'll need to push the rewritten Git history to your remote repository using `git push --force origin <branch_name>`. Be aware that rewriting history can impact collaborators, so communication is key.

It's important to note that migrating to LFS is a destructive operation that rewrites the Git history. Therefore, it's highly recommended to create a backup of your repository before starting the migration process. Also, consider the impact on collaborators and ensure they are aware of the changes and how to update their local repositories after the migration.
