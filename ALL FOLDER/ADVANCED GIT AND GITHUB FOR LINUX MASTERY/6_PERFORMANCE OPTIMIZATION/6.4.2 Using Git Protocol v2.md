Git Protocol v2 is a significant improvement over its predecessor, designed to optimize network performance, especially when dealing with large repositories or slow connections. It achieves this by reducing the number of round trips between the client and server during operations like `git fetch` and `git push`. Instead of requesting information piecemeal, Protocol v2 allows the client to request a comprehensive list of references and their associated objects in a single request. This drastically cuts down on latency and improves overall speed.

A key advantage of Protocol v2 is its ability to filter the data transferred. For example, when fetching, the client can specify exactly which references it needs, avoiding the transfer of unnecessary data. This is particularly useful when working with repositories containing numerous branches or tags. Another example is the improved negotiation process, where the client and server can more efficiently determine the common ancestor commits, leading to smaller pack files and faster transfers.

To enable Protocol v2, ensure your Git client is version 2.18 or later. It's generally enabled by default in newer versions. You can explicitly configure it using:

```bash
git config --global protocol.version 2
```

This setting will instruct Git to attempt to use Protocol v2 whenever possible, falling back to older protocols if the server doesn't support it.
