This section focuses on installing and configuring Git Large File Storage (LFS) on your Linux system. Git LFS is an extension that allows you to manage large files (audio, video, datasets, graphics, etc.) in your Git repository without bloating the repository itself. Instead of storing the large files directly in the Git repository, Git LFS stores pointers to these files, while the actual file content is stored on a separate LFS server. This keeps your repository lightweight and efficient, especially when collaborating on projects with large assets.

The installation process typically involves using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you would use `apt-get`, while on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL, you would use `yum` or `dnf`. After installation, you need to initialize Git LFS within your Git repository using the `git lfs install` command. This command sets up the necessary Git hooks and configuration to enable LFS tracking.

Once installed and initialized, you can start tracking large files using the `git lfs track` command. For example, to track all `.psd` files, you would run `git lfs track "*.psd"`. This command creates a `.gitattributes` file (or modifies an existing one) that tells Git LFS to manage files matching the specified pattern. Remember to commit the `.gitattributes` file to your repository so that the LFS configuration is shared with other collaborators.
