Large files in your Git repository can significantly impact performance, increase clone times, and consume excessive storage space. Identifying and removing these files is crucial for maintaining a healthy and efficient repository. This section covers strategies for removing large files from your Git history, ensuring a cleaner and more manageable repository.

One common scenario is accidentally committing large binary files, such as images or videos, directly into the repository. Another is accumulating large build artifacts over time. Tools like `git filter-branch` and the BFG Repo-Cleaner can rewrite your repository's history, effectively removing these files from all commits. However, rewriting history can be disruptive, so careful planning and communication with collaborators are essential.

For example, if you accidentally committed a 50MB video file named `my_video.mp4`, you could use the BFG Repo-Cleaner with the command `bfg --delete-files my_video.mp4`. This command will rewrite the history, removing all instances of `my_video.mp4` from your repository. Remember to back up your repository before performing any history rewriting operations.
