Git LFS significantly impacts collaborative workflows, especially when dealing with large assets like audio files, videos, datasets, or graphics. While Git efficiently manages text-based code, it struggles with large binary files, leading to repository bloat and slow performance. LFS addresses this by storing these large files separately and only tracking pointers within the Git repository. This means collaborators can clone and work with the repository without downloading the entire history of large files unless they specifically need them.

Effective collaboration with LFS requires a shared understanding of how LFS works and how to manage large files. For example, if a game development team is using Git for version control, they can use LFS to store large texture files. When a designer updates a texture, only the pointer to the new version is committed to Git, while the actual texture file is stored on the LFS server. Other team members only download the updated texture when they check out the specific commit containing the change or explicitly request it.

Properly configuring LFS and communicating its usage within the team is crucial. Tools like `.gitattributes` are essential for specifying which file types should be tracked by LFS. For instance, adding `*.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text` to `.gitattributes` tells Git LFS to manage all Photoshop files. Clear communication about LFS usage, including how to install LFS (`git lfs install`), track files (`git lfs track "*.psd"`), and pull LFS objects (`git lfs pull`), ensures a smooth and efficient collaborative workflow.
