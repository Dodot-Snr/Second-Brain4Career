Git Large File Storage (LFS) is a Git extension designed to handle large files, such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics, which are often problematic for standard Git repositories. Instead of storing the large files directly in the repository, Git LFS stores pointers to these files, while the actual file content is stored on a separate LFS server. This keeps your repository lightweight and prevents performance issues associated with tracking large binary files.

By using Git LFS, you can significantly reduce the size of your Git repository and improve cloning, fetching, and pushing times. This is especially crucial when working with projects that involve multimedia assets or large datasets. Git LFS also provides features like file locking to prevent conflicts when multiple users are working on the same large file.

For example, to track all `.psd` files in your repository with Git LFS, you would run:

```bash
git lfs track "*.psd"
```

This creates a `.gitattributes` file (or modifies an existing one) that tells Git LFS to manage files matching the specified pattern. After tracking, you commit the `.gitattributes` file and the large files as usual. When you push, Git LFS automatically uploads the large files to the LFS server.
