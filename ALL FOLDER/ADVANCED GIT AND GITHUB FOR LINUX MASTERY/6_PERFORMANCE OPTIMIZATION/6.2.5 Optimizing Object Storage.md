Object storage within your Git repository can significantly impact its size and performance. Large files, especially those that change frequently, contribute heavily to bloat. Optimizing object storage involves identifying and managing these large objects to keep your repository lean and efficient. This often involves techniques like using Git Large File Storage (LFS) for binary assets, rewriting history to remove large files that were mistakenly committed, and ensuring proper configuration to prevent future bloat.

One common scenario is accidentally committing large media files (images, videos, audio) directly into the repository. These files are stored as objects, and every version of them is tracked, quickly inflating the repository size. A solution is to migrate these files to Git LFS. For example, if you have a `logo.png` file that's 10MB, you would track it with LFS using `git lfs track "logo.png"` and then commit the changes. LFS stores the actual file content externally, replacing it with a pointer in the Git repository. Another example is using `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` to remove large files from the entire history of the repository if they were committed in the past.

```bash
git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 10M
```

This command removes all blobs larger than 10MB from the repository's history.
