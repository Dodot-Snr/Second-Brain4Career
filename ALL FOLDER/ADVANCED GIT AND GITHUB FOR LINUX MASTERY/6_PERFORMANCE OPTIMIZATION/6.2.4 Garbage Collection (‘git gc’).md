Git's garbage collection mechanism, invoked by the `git gc` command, is crucial for maintaining a healthy and efficient repository, especially as it grows over time. It primarily aims to clean up loose objects, pack them into packfiles, and prune unreachable objects, thereby reducing the repository's overall size and improving performance. Think of it as tidying up your Git workspace, removing unnecessary clutter and optimizing the storage of your project's history.

`git gc` performs several operations, including compressing file revisions (delta compression), removing redundant packfiles, and pruning objects that are no longer referenced by any branch or tag. While Git usually runs `git gc --auto` periodically in the background, manually running `git gc` can be beneficial after significant changes, such as large merges or history rewrites. For example, after using `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive data, running `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` will permanently remove the filtered data from your repository's history.

It's important to note that `git gc` can be resource-intensive, especially on large repositories. The `--aggressive` flag, while providing more thorough optimization, takes significantly longer. Therefore, it's generally recommended to run `git gc` during off-peak hours or on a dedicated maintenance machine.
