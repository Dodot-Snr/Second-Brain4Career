Git's core functionality revolves around a content-addressable object storage system. This means that every piece of data within your repository – files, directories, commit messages, and more – is stored as a unique object, identified by a SHA-1 hash of its content. This hash acts as the object's address, ensuring that if the content changes, the hash changes, and a new object is created. This system provides integrity and efficiency, as identical content is only stored once.

Git uses four primary object types: blobs (representing file data), trees (representing directories), commits (representing snapshots of the repository), and tags (representing references to specific commits). When you add a file to your staging area using `git add`, Git creates a blob object containing the file's content and stores it in the object database. Similarly, when you commit, Git creates a tree object representing the directory structure at that point in time, referencing the blob objects for the files within. The commit object then points to the tree object, along with metadata like the author, committer, and commit message.

For example, if you have a file named `my_script.sh` with the content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

Git will create a blob object for this content. The SHA-1 hash of this blob becomes its unique identifier within the repository. If you later modify `my_script.sh`, Git will create a _new_ blob object with a different SHA-1 hash, reflecting the changed content. This object storage mechanism is fundamental to Git's version control capabilities.
