Trees in Git are essentially directory snapshots. They don't store actual file data, but rather point to blobs (which hold file content) and other trees (subdirectories). Think of a tree as a file system directory, but instead of files and folders, it contains pointers to blobs and other trees. This hierarchical structure allows Git to represent the entire history of your project's directory structure.

Each tree object contains a list of entries, where each entry represents a file or subdirectory. An entry includes the mode (file type and permissions), the name of the file or directory, and the SHA-1 hash of the corresponding blob (for files) or tree (for subdirectories). This structure enables Git to efficiently track changes to the directory structure and content of your project over time. For example, if you add a new file to a directory, Git creates a new tree object representing the updated directory, with a new entry pointing to the blob containing the file's content.

Consider a simple example: a directory named `my_project` contains a file `README.md` and a subdirectory `src`. The `my_project` tree would have two entries: one for `README.md` pointing to its blob, and another for `src` pointing to another tree object representing the contents of the `src` directory. This nested structure allows Git to represent complex directory hierarchies.
