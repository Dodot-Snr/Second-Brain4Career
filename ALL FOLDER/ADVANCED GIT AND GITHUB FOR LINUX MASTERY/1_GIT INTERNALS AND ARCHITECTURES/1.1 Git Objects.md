Git's core functionality revolves around its object database, a content-addressable storage system. Every piece of data in your Git repository – files, directories, commit messages, and more – is stored as a Git object. These objects are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be changed. Git uses a SHA-1 hash of the object's content to uniquely identify each object, ensuring data integrity and efficient storage. Understanding Git objects is crucial for comprehending Git's internal workings and performing advanced operations.

There are four primary types of Git objects: blobs, trees, commits, and tags. Blobs represent the content of files. Trees represent directories, storing references to blobs (files) and other trees (subdirectories). Commits represent snapshots of the repository at a specific point in time, linking to a tree object representing the top-level directory and containing metadata like author, committer, and commit message. Tags are references to specific commits, providing a human-readable alias.

For example, when you add a file named `my_script.sh` to your staging area and commit it, Git creates a blob object containing the file's content. It then creates a tree object representing the directory containing `my_script.sh`, with a reference to the blob. Finally, it creates a commit object that points to this tree, along with information about the author, committer, and a commit message. You can view the object type and hash using commands like `git cat-file -t <object_hash>` and `git cat-file -p <object_hash>`.
