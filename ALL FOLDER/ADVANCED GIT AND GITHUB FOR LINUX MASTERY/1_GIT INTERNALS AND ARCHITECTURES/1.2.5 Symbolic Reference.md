Symbolic references, unlike direct references (which store a commit SHA-1), hold the name of another reference. Think of them as pointers or aliases. The most common example is `HEAD`, which usually points to the branch you're currently working on. When you perform a `git checkout <branch>`, `HEAD` is updated to point to that branch's reference. Symbolic references are resolved recursively until a direct reference (a commit SHA-1) is found.

Symbolic references provide a level of indirection that can be useful in various scenarios. For instance, you can create a symbolic reference to a specific tag or branch, allowing you to easily refer to it without needing to remember the exact name. This can be particularly helpful when dealing with long or complex branch names.

For example, you can create a symbolic reference named `my_alias` pointing to the `develop` branch:

```bash
git symbolic-ref refs/my_alias refs/heads/develop
```

Now, `refs/my_alias` will always point to whatever commit `refs/heads/develop` points to. If `develop` is updated, `my_alias` will automatically reflect that change. You can then view the target of the symbolic reference using:

```bash
git symbolic-ref refs/my_alias
```
