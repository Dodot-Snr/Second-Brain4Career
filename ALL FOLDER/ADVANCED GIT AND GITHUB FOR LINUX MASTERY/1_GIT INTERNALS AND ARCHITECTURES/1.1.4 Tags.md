Tags in Git are essentially pointers to specific points in your repository's history. Unlike branches, which are mutable and evolve as you add commits, tags are typically used to mark release points or significant milestones. They provide a human-readable and persistent way to refer to a particular commit, making it easy to revisit and work with specific versions of your project. Think of them as bookmarks in your project's timeline.

There are two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated. Lightweight tags are simply pointers to a commit and don't store any additional information. Annotated tags, on the other hand, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They contain the tagger name, email, date, and a tagging message. Annotated tags are generally recommended for releases because they provide more context and are less likely to be accidentally moved.

For example, you might tag a release with `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"` to create an annotated tag. Later, you can refer to that specific version of your code using the `v1.0` tag. To create a lightweight tag, you can use `git tag v1.1`. You can list all tags using `git tag`.
