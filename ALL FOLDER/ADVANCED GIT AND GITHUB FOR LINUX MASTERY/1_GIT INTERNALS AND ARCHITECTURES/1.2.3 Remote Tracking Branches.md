Remote tracking branches are local references to the state of remote branches. They act as bookmarks, recording the last known location of branches on your remote repositories (like `origin`). These branches are crucial for understanding how your local repository relates to the remote repository and for coordinating collaboration. They are automatically updated when you fetch from the remote. You typically don't directly commit to these branches; instead, you use them as a reference point for creating local branches and merging changes.

Think of `origin/main` as your local record of what the `main` branch looked like on the `origin` remote the last time you fetched. When you run `git fetch origin`, Git updates all your remote tracking branches to reflect the current state of the `origin` remote. This allows you to compare your local branches to the remote state and determine if you need to pull changes. For example, if you see that `origin/main` is ahead of your local `main` branch, it means there are new commits on the remote that you need to integrate.

A common workflow involves creating a local branch based on a remote tracking branch: `git checkout -b my-feature origin/main`. This creates a new branch named `my-feature` that starts at the same commit as `origin/main`. You can then work on your feature, and when you're ready, you can push your changes to a remote branch (often with the same name) and create a pull request.
