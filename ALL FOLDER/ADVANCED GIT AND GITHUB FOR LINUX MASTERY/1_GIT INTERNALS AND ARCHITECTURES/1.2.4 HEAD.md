HEAD is a symbolic reference to the currently checked-out commit. Think of it as Git's pointer to the commit you're working on. It generally points to the tip of your current branch, making it easy for Git to know where to add new commits when you use `git commit`. When you switch branches using `git checkout <branch_name>`, HEAD is updated to point to the tip of the new branch.

In most cases, HEAD points to a branch name. However, it can also point directly to a specific commit. This is known as "detached HEAD" state. This happens when you checkout a specific commit hash instead of a branch. For example, `git checkout <commit_hash>`. While in detached HEAD state, any new commits you make will not be associated with any branch and can be lost if you switch back to a branch without creating a new branch from your detached HEAD.

Understanding HEAD is crucial for navigating your Git repository and understanding how Git tracks your changes. It's the key to understanding branching, merging, and reverting changes.
