Git stores data as objects within its `.git/objects` directory. Initially, these objects are stored as _loose objects_, meaning each object (blobs, trees, commits) is stored as a separate file. This is simple and straightforward for creating new objects. However, as a repository grows, having thousands of individual files becomes inefficient in terms of storage space and performance.

To address this, Git uses _packfiles_. A packfile is a single file containing multiple Git objects, compressed and deltafied (meaning similar objects are stored as differences from each other). This significantly reduces the overall repository size and improves performance, especially for network operations like cloning and pushing. Git automatically creates and manages packfiles through operations like `git gc` (garbage collection).

For example, after committing a few files, you might see loose objects in `.git/objects`. Running `git gc` will then consolidate these loose objects into a packfile, which you can find in `.git/objects/pack`. The loose objects will then be removed (or become unreachable). Another example is when you clone a repository; you're typically downloading a packfile, which Git then unpacks into loose objects (initially) or keeps as a packfile.
