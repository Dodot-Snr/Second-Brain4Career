Tags in Git are essentially snapshots of specific points in your repository's history. Unlike branches, which are mutable and evolve as you add commits, tags are designed to be permanent markers, typically used to label release versions (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.0-beta`). They provide a human-readable way to refer to a particular commit, making it easy to check out a specific version of your project later on. Think of them as bookmarks in your Git history.

There are two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated. Lightweight tags are simply pointers to a commit and don't store any extra information. Annotated tags, on the other hand, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They contain the tagger's name, email, date, and a message. Annotated tags are generally recommended because they provide more context and are less likely to be accidentally moved or deleted.

For example, to create an annotated tag named `v1.0` pointing to the current commit, you would use the command:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
```

To create a lightweight tag, you would simply omit the `-a` and `-m` options:

```bash
git tag v1.0-lightweight
```

You can then push your tags to a remote repository using `git push origin --tags`.
