Blobs, short for Binary Large Objects, are one of the core object types in Git's content-addressable file system. They represent the content of a file at a specific point in time. Think of them as snapshots of your files. Unlike commits or trees, blobs don't contain any metadata about filenames, timestamps, or relationships to other objects. They simply store the raw data. Git uses zlib compression to efficiently store blobs, minimizing disk space usage.

When you add a file to the staging area using `git add`, Git calculates the SHA-1 hash of the file's content. If a blob with that hash already exists in the object database, Git simply reuses it. Otherwise, Git creates a new blob object containing the file's content and stores it in the `.git/objects` directory. This content-addressable storage is what allows Git to be so efficient at tracking changes and managing versions. For example, if you have two identical files in different directories, Git will only store one blob object for both.

To see the content of a blob, you can use the `git cat-file -p <blob_hash>` command. For instance, if you have a blob with the hash `e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391`, running `git cat-file -p e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391` will display the file's content (assuming it's a text file). If it's a binary file, the output might be unreadable.
