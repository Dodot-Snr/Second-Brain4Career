Git uses a cryptographic hash function called SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) to uniquely identify every object in its object database. These objects include blobs (file content), trees (directory structure), and commits (snapshots of the repository). SHA-1 takes the content of an object as input and produces a fixed-size 40-character hexadecimal string. This hash acts as the object's name and ensures data integrity. If the content of an object changes, the SHA-1 hash will also change, creating a new, distinct object.

The SHA-1 hash is calculated based on the object's type, size, and content. This means that two files with identical content, stored at different times, will have the same SHA-1 hash. This allows Git to efficiently store and retrieve objects, as it can quickly determine if an object already exists in the repository. For example, if you add a file named `my_script.sh` with the content "echo 'Hello, world!'", Git will calculate its SHA-1 hash. If you later add another file, `another_script.sh`, with the exact same content, Git will recognize that the object already exists and simply point to the existing object with the same SHA-1 hash, saving storage space.

While SHA-1 has known vulnerabilities and is being phased out in favor of stronger hashing algorithms like SHA-256 in newer Git versions, understanding its role is crucial for comprehending Git's internal workings. You can see the SHA-1 hash of a blob object using `git cat-file -t <object_hash>` to determine the object type and `git cat-file -p <object_hash>` to view the object's content. For example:

```bash
git cat-file -t a8b92345c6789012d345e678f90123456789abcd # Example SHA-1 hash
blob
git cat-file -p a8b92345c6789012d345e678f90123456789abcd # Example SHA-1 hash
This is the content of the file.
```
