Commits are the cornerstone of Git's version control system. They are essentially snapshots of your entire project at a specific point in time. Each commit contains metadata like the author, committer, date, and a descriptive message explaining the changes made. Crucially, a commit also points to the tree object representing the directory structure and file contents of that snapshot, as well as the commit(s) that came before it (its parent(s)). This creates a linked history, allowing Git to track changes over time.

Think of a commit as a permanent record of your work. When you make changes to your files and stage them, you're preparing them to be included in the next commit. The `git commit -m "Your descriptive message"` command packages these staged changes into a new commit object. The message is vital; it should clearly and concisely explain _why_ the changes were made, not just _what_ was changed. Good commit messages make it easier to understand the project's history and collaborate effectively.

For example, instead of a vague message like "Fixed bug," a better message would be "Fix: Prevented crash when processing malformed input data. Added input validation to `process_data()` function." This provides context and makes it easier to understand the purpose of the commit later on. Another example: "Refactor: Extracted database connection logic into a separate module for improved maintainability."
