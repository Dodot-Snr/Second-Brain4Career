Version controlling infrastructure configuration is a critical aspect of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It involves managing your infrastructure definitions (e.g., server setups, network configurations, and application deployments) using version control systems like Git. This allows you to track changes, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous states if necessary, ensuring consistency and reliability in your infrastructure. By treating your infrastructure as code, you gain the benefits of version control, such as branching, merging, and code review, leading to improved stability and reduced errors.

Consider using tools like Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation to define your infrastructure. These tools allow you to describe your desired infrastructure state in declarative configuration files. These files are then committed to a Git repository. For example, a Terraform configuration file might define the creation of an AWS EC2 instance with specific configurations. Similarly, an Ansible playbook could define the steps to install and configure software on a server.

```terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b987928ac7a75"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
```

By version controlling these configuration files, you can easily track changes to your infrastructure, collaborate with your team, and roll back to previous versions if needed. This practice is essential for maintaining a stable and reproducible infrastructure environment.
