Security Alerts are a crucial component of GitHub Advanced Security, providing automated notifications about potential vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. These alerts help you proactively identify and address security risks before they can be exploited. GitHub monitors your repository's dependency graph and compares it against a database of known vulnerabilities. When a vulnerability is detected in a dependency, GitHub generates a security alert, notifying repository maintainers and contributors with write access.

These alerts provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including the affected dependency, the severity of the vulnerability (e.g., critical, high, moderate, low), and links to relevant resources like the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. For example, you might receive an alert indicating that the `lodash` library used in your project has a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. GitHub often provides suggested remediation steps, such as upgrading to a patched version of the dependency. Ignoring these alerts can leave your project vulnerable to attack, while promptly addressing them significantly improves your project's security posture.
