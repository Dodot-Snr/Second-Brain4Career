Git hooks are scripts that Git executes automatically before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They can be leveraged within a CI/CD pipeline to automate tasks like code linting, running tests, and even deploying code. By integrating Git hooks, you can ensure code quality and consistency before changes are integrated into the main codebase, ultimately streamlining the CI/CD process.

For example, a `pre-commit` hook could be configured to run a linter like `flake8` on Python code. If the linter finds any errors, the commit is rejected, forcing the developer to fix the issues before proceeding. Similarly, a `pre-push` hook could execute a suite of unit tests. If any tests fail, the push is prevented, ensuring that only code that passes all tests is pushed to the remote repository. This proactive approach helps catch errors early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into production.

Here's a simple example of a `pre-commit` hook that runs `flake8`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
flake8 .
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Flake8 found errors. Please fix them before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```
