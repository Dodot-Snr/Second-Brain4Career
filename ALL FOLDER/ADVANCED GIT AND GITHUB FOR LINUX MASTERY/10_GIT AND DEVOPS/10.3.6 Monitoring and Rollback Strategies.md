Effective CI/CD pipelines don't end with deployment; they extend to continuous monitoring and robust rollback strategies. Monitoring allows you to observe the health and performance of your application in production, identifying issues before they significantly impact users. Rollback strategies provide a safety net, enabling you to quickly revert to a stable state if a new deployment introduces critical bugs or performance regressions. Without these, even the most automated CI/CD pipeline can lead to prolonged outages and user dissatisfaction.

Monitoring involves tracking key metrics like error rates, response times, resource utilization (CPU, memory), and user behavior. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack are commonly used for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing these metrics. For example, you might set up alerts to trigger if the error rate exceeds a certain threshold, indicating a potential problem with the latest deployment. Rollback strategies can range from simple (redeploying the previous version) to more complex (using feature flags to disable problematic features).

A key example of a rollback strategy is using Git tags to mark stable releases. If a new deployment (e.g., tagged `v2.0`) introduces issues, you can quickly revert to the previous stable tag (e.g., `v1.9`) by checking out that tag and redeploying. Another example is using blue/green deployments, where you maintain two identical environments (blue and green). You deploy the new version to the inactive environment, test it, and then switch traffic to it. If issues arise, you can quickly switch traffic back to the original environment.
