GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) is a suite of features designed to help developers secure their code and prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production. It integrates directly into your GitHub workflow, providing automated security checks and insights without requiring you to leave the platform. GHAS helps identify and remediate vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, reducing the risk of security breaches and improving the overall security posture of your projects.

GHAS includes features like code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review. Code scanning analyzes your code for potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS), and provides actionable recommendations for remediation. Secret scanning detects accidentally committed secrets, like API keys or passwords, and helps prevent them from being exposed. Dependency review identifies vulnerable dependencies in your project and helps you upgrade to secure versions. For example, if your project uses a vulnerable version of the `lodash` library, dependency review will flag it and suggest upgrading to a patched version.

By enabling GHAS, you can proactively identify and address security risks before they become major problems. This not only protects your code and data but also helps you build more secure and reliable applications. For instance, imagine you accidentally commit an AWS access key to your repository. GHAS secret scanning would detect this and alert you immediately, allowing you to revoke the key and prevent unauthorized access to your AWS resources.
