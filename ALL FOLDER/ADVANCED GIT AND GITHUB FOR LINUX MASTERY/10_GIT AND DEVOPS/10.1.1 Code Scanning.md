Code scanning is a powerful feature within GitHub Advanced Security that allows you to analyze the code in your repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. It uses static analysis techniques to identify potential problems before they even make it into production. This proactive approach helps prevent security breaches and improve the overall quality of your codebase. Code scanning can be configured to run automatically on every commit, pull request, or on a scheduled basis, providing continuous monitoring of your code.

The process involves scanning your code with a variety of security tools and linters. These tools look for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows, as well as coding errors that could lead to unexpected behavior. The results are then displayed directly within GitHub, allowing developers to easily review and address any identified issues. This integration into the development workflow makes it easier to incorporate security best practices into your daily routine.

For example, a code scanning tool might identify a potential SQL injection vulnerability in a Python script:

```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"
cursor.execute(query)
```

Code scanning would flag this because the `username` variable is directly concatenated into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection if the `username` variable is not properly sanitized. Another example could be identifying a hardcoded password in a configuration file. By addressing these issues early, you can significantly reduce the risk of security incidents.
