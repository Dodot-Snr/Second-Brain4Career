GitOps is a modern approach to managing infrastructure and application deployments by leveraging Git as a single source of truth. It extends the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by using Git workflows to automate and manage infrastructure changes. Instead of manually configuring servers or using imperative scripts, GitOps relies on declarative configurations stored in Git repositories. Any changes to the desired state are made through Git commits, pull requests, and merges, triggering automated deployments.

The core idea behind GitOps is that the entire system's state should be defined in Git. An automated operator then continuously monitors the Git repository and compares the desired state with the actual state of the infrastructure. If there's a discrepancy, the operator automatically reconciles the environment to match the Git repository. This ensures consistency, auditability, and faster recovery from failures.

For example, imagine you want to deploy a new version of your application. In a GitOps workflow, you would update the application's deployment manifest (e.g., a Kubernetes YAML file) in your Git repository. The GitOps operator, such as Argo CD or Flux, would detect the change and automatically deploy the new version to your Kubernetes cluster. Similarly, if someone accidentally modifies a server configuration directly, the GitOps operator would revert it back to the state defined in Git, preventing configuration drift.
