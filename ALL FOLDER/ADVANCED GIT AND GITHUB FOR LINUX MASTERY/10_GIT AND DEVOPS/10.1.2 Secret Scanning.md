Secret Scanning, a feature within GitHub Advanced Security, helps you prevent secrets (like API keys, passwords, and tokens) from being committed to your repository. It works by automatically scanning your repository's code, commit history, and pull requests for known secret patterns. When a secret is detected, GitHub alerts you and the secret's provider (if applicable), allowing you to revoke the compromised secret and prevent unauthorized access. This proactive approach significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and security vulnerabilities.

Secret Scanning supports a wide range of secret types, including those from popular cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, as well as common API keys and credentials. For example, if you accidentally commit an AWS access key ID to your repository, Secret Scanning will detect it and notify you. Similarly, if you include a private SSH key in your code, it will be flagged. This automated detection helps developers catch mistakes early in the development lifecycle, before they can be exploited.
