Integrating Git with CI/CD pipelines is crucial for automating the software development lifecycle. It allows developers to automatically build, test, and deploy code changes whenever new commits are pushed to a Git repository. This integration streamlines the development process, reduces errors, and accelerates the delivery of software updates. The core idea is to trigger pipeline executions based on Git events, such as pushes, pull requests, or merges.

A common example is configuring a CI/CD pipeline to run automated tests whenever a developer pushes code to a feature branch. The pipeline will checkout the code, build the application, run unit and integration tests, and report the results back to the developer. If the tests pass, the developer can then merge the feature branch into the main branch. Another example is automatically deploying a new version of an application to a staging environment when a pull request is merged into the main branch. This allows for thorough testing and validation before deploying to production.

To achieve this integration, CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI are configured to monitor Git repositories for specific events. These tools use webhooks or polling mechanisms to detect changes and trigger the corresponding pipeline stages. The pipeline definitions, often stored in files like `.gitlab-ci.yml` or `Jenkinsfile` within the Git repository, specify the steps to be executed for each event. For example, a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file might contain:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application..."
    - make build

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - make test

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the application..."
    - make deploy
  only:
    - main
```
