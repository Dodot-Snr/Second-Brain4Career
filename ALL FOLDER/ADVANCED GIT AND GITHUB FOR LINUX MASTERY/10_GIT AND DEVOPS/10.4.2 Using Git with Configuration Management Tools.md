Configuration Management (CM) tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack automate the process of configuring and maintaining systems. Integrating Git with these tools provides version control for your infrastructure code, enabling you to track changes, collaborate effectively, and roll back to previous configurations if needed. This integration is crucial for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, where infrastructure is defined and managed through code rather than manual processes.

By storing your playbooks, manifests, and recipes in Git repositories, you gain the benefits of version control, branching, and pull requests. This allows for a structured and auditable workflow for infrastructure changes. For example, you can create a branch to test a new configuration change, and then use a pull request to review and merge the changes into the main branch. This ensures that all changes are properly vetted before being deployed to production.

A common example is using Ansible to deploy applications. Your Ansible playbooks, which define the steps to install and configure the application, are stored in a Git repository. When you need to update the application, you modify the playbooks in a branch, test the changes, and then merge them into the main branch. Ansible then pulls the latest version of the playbooks from the Git repository and applies the changes to the target servers. Another example is using Puppet to manage system configurations. Puppet manifests, which describe the desired state of the system, are stored in Git. Puppet agents then pull the latest manifests from the Git repository and enforce the desired state on the managed nodes.

```bash
# Example: Ansible pulling playbooks from a Git repository
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: webserver
      src: git+https://github.com/your-org/webserver-role.git,v1.2.3
```
