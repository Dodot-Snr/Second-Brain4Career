Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, rather than through manual processes. This allows you to treat your infrastructure configuration files like any other code, enabling version control, automated testing, and repeatable deployments. By defining your infrastructure in code, you can easily create, modify, and destroy environments in a consistent and predictable manner. This approach significantly reduces the risk of human error, improves efficiency, and promotes collaboration among development and operations teams.

IaC leverages tools and technologies to automate the provisioning and management of servers, networks, storage, and other infrastructure components. Popular IaC tools include Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation. For example, you might use Terraform to define your AWS EC2 instances, networking rules, and security groups in a configuration file. Similarly, Ansible can be used to automate the configuration of software and settings on those instances. By storing these configurations in Git repositories, you can track changes, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous states if necessary. This integration with Git and GitHub is crucial for maintaining a reliable and auditable infrastructure.
