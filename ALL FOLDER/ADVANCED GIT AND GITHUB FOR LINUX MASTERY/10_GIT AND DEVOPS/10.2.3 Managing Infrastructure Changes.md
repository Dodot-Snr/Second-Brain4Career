Within the realm of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), effectively managing changes to your infrastructure definitions is paramount. This involves using Git and GitHub to track, review, and deploy modifications to your infrastructure code, ensuring consistency, auditability, and reduced risk. By treating your infrastructure configuration files as code, you can leverage Git's branching, version control, and collaboration features to streamline the change management process. This approach allows for controlled updates, easy rollbacks, and a clear history of all modifications made to your infrastructure.

A key aspect of managing infrastructure changes is using pull requests for all modifications. For example, if you need to update the memory allocation for a virtual machine defined in a Terraform configuration file, you would create a new branch, make the necessary changes, and then submit a pull request. This allows other team members to review the changes, provide feedback, and ensure that the update aligns with the overall infrastructure strategy. Another example is using Git tags to mark specific releases of your infrastructure code, enabling you to easily revert to a previous stable state if necessary.

By adopting a Git-centric workflow for managing infrastructure changes, you can significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of your infrastructure. This approach promotes collaboration, reduces errors, and provides a clear audit trail of all modifications, ultimately leading to a more robust and efficient infrastructure management process.
