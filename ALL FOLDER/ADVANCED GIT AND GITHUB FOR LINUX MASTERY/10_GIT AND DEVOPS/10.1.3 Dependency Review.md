Dependency Review is a feature within GitHub Advanced Security that helps you understand and control the dependencies introduced in your pull requests. It scans your project's dependency files (like `package.json` for Node.js or `requirements.txt` for Python) and identifies any new, updated, or removed dependencies. This allows you to proactively assess the security and licensing implications of these changes _before_ they are merged into your main branch. By catching vulnerabilities early, you can prevent potentially harmful code from entering your codebase.

The primary benefit of Dependency Review is the ability to visualize the impact of dependency changes. For example, if a pull request introduces a new dependency with a known security vulnerability, Dependency Review will flag it, providing details about the vulnerability and its severity. Similarly, it can highlight changes in dependency licenses, ensuring compliance with your organization's policies. This proactive approach helps maintain a secure and compliant software supply chain.

Consider a scenario where a developer adds a new JavaScript library to their project using `npm install vulnerable-package`. Dependency Review would immediately detect that `vulnerable-package` has known vulnerabilities and alert the team. Another example is when a developer updates a Python package using `pip install requests==2.28.0`. Dependency Review can verify that this specific version of `requests` doesn't introduce any new security concerns or license changes compared to the previous version.
