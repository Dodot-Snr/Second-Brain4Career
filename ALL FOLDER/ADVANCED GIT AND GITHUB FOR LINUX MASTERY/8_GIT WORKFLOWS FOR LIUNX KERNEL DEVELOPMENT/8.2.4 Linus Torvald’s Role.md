Linus Torvalds is the creator of Linux and the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) of the Linux kernel project. His role is pivotal in maintaining the integrity and direction of the kernel. While a vast community contributes code, Torvalds has the final say on which changes are merged into the official kernel tree. He sets the overall technical direction, resolves disputes, and ensures the kernel remains stable and efficient. His deep understanding of the kernel's architecture and his commitment to quality are crucial for its continued success.

Torvalds' primary responsibility is reviewing and merging code submitted by subsystem maintainers. These maintainers are responsible for specific parts of the kernel, such as networking, memory management, or device drivers. They, in turn, review contributions from individual developers. Torvalds' involvement ensures that all changes adhere to the kernel's coding style, architecture, and overall design principles. A key example is his famous "Linus says no" moments, where he rejects patches that he deems unsuitable, often with colorful language. Another example is his active participation in kernel mailing lists, where he provides feedback, guidance, and sometimes, blunt criticism.

His Git repository, `torvalds/linux`, is the official source of the Linux kernel. All accepted changes ultimately end up in this repository. While many developers contribute, Torvalds' oversight ensures the kernel remains a cohesive and well-maintained project. He also manages the release cycle, deciding when to create new kernel versions and setting the schedule for feature development and bug fixes.
