Hardcoding secrets directly into your code, configuration files, or scripts is a major security vulnerability. If these secrets are exposed (e.g., through a public repository, a compromised server, or even a simple `grep` command), attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources, databases, or even your entire infrastructure. This practice directly contradicts the principle of least privilege and significantly increases the attack surface.

Instead of hardcoding, you should leverage environment variables, configuration files with restricted access, or dedicated secret management tools. For example, instead of writing `password = "P@sswOrd123"` directly in your Python script, you should retrieve the password from an environment variable: `password = os.environ.get("DATABASE_PASSWORD")`. Similarly, avoid committing API keys directly into your Git repository.

Consider using tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage your secrets. These tools provide features like encryption, access control, and auditing, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your secrets. Remember, security is a layered approach, and avoiding hardcoded secrets is a crucial first step.
