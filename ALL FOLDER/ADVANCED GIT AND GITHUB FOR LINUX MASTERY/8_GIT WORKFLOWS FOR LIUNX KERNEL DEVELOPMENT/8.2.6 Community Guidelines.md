Contributing to the Linux kernel, or any large open-source project, isn't just about writing code. It's about participating in a community. This means adhering to established community guidelines and respecting the norms of communication and collaboration. These guidelines are in place to ensure a productive, respectful, and inclusive environment for all contributors. Ignoring them can lead to your patches being rejected or, in severe cases, being banned from contributing.

Key aspects of these guidelines include using proper coding style (as defined by the kernel's `Documentation/process/coding-style.rst` file), writing clear and concise commit messages (following the established format), and engaging in respectful and constructive discussions on mailing lists. For example, when submitting a patch, you should always include a `Signed-off-by:` line in your commit message, indicating that you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). Another example is using plain text emails instead of HTML emails when communicating on the mailing lists.

Understanding and following these guidelines is crucial for successful kernel development. It demonstrates respect for the community and increases the likelihood of your contributions being accepted. Failing to do so can create friction and hinder the collaborative process.
