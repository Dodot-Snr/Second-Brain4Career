Kernel Continuous Integration (CI) is a crucial component of modern kernel development, ensuring code quality and stability through automated testing. It involves automatically building and testing kernel patches as they are submitted, providing rapid feedback to developers. This helps identify bugs, regressions, and other issues early in the development cycle, preventing them from making their way into the mainline kernel. Kernel CI systems typically run a variety of tests, including compilation tests, boot tests, functional tests, and performance benchmarks, across a range of architectures and configurations.

A key example of Kernel CI in action is the 0-day bot. This bot automatically builds and tests patches submitted to kernel mailing lists, reporting any build errors or warnings back to the submitter. Another example is the LKP (Linux Kernel Performance) project, which focuses on performance testing and regression detection. These systems help maintain the high quality and stability of the Linux kernel by providing continuous feedback and automated testing throughout the development process.
