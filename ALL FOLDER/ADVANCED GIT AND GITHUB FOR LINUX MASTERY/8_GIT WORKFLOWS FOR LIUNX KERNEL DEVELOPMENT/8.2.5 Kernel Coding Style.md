The Linux kernel has a very specific coding style, meticulously documented in `Documentation/process/coding-style.rst` within the kernel source tree. Adhering to this style is crucial for contributing to the kernel. It promotes readability, maintainability, and consistency across the vast codebase. Ignoring these guidelines is a surefire way to have your patches rejected. The style covers everything from indentation and naming conventions to commenting and function length.

Key aspects include using tabs for indentation (8 characters wide), limiting line length to 80 characters, and using descriptive variable names. Functions should generally be kept short and focused, ideally no more than a screenful of code. Comments are essential for explaining complex logic and the purpose of functions and variables.

For example, consider indentation. Instead of spaces, tabs are used:

```c
// Correct indentation
if (condition) {
	do_something();
}

// Incorrect indentation
if (condition) {
  do_something();
}
```

Another example is the use of curly braces. They are always required, even for single-line statements, to avoid ambiguity and potential errors:

```c
// Correct
if (condition) {
	do_something();
}

//Incorrect (and dangerous!)
if (condition)
	do_something();
```

Understanding and following the kernel coding style is a fundamental step in contributing effectively to the Linux kernel.
