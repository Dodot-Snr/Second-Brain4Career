Input validation is a crucial secure coding practice that involves verifying that data entering your application meets specific criteria before processing it. This helps prevent malicious or malformed data from causing unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, or system crashes. By carefully scrutinizing input, you can mitigate risks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, and other common attack vectors. Effective input validation should be implemented at multiple layers of your application, including the client-side (for immediate feedback) and, most importantly, the server-side (for robust security).

The goal is to define what constitutes "good" data and reject anything that deviates from that definition. This can involve checking data types, lengths, formats, and ranges. For example, if you're expecting an integer representing a user's age, you should verify that the input is indeed an integer and falls within a reasonable age range (e.g., 0-120). Similarly, if you're expecting an email address, you should validate that it conforms to a standard email format using regular expressions.

Consider a scenario where a script takes a filename as input and then executes a command using that filename. Without proper validation, an attacker could inject malicious commands into the filename, leading to arbitrary code execution. For example, if the script uses the filename directly in a `system()` call:

```bash
filename = input("Enter filename: ")
system("cat " + filename)
```

An attacker could enter `"; rm -rf /"` as the filename, which would then be executed as `cat ; rm -rf /`, potentially deleting all files on the system. Input validation, such as whitelisting allowed characters or limiting the filename length, could prevent this.
