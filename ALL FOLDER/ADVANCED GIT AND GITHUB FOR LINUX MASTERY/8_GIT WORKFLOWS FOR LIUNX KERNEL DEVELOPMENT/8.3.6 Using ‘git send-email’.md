The `git send-email` command is a powerful tool for contributing to projects, particularly the Linux kernel, that primarily rely on email-based patch submission rather than pull requests. It allows you to format your commits as emails and send them directly to the maintainers or mailing lists responsible for the project. This is crucial for projects where direct repository access is limited and collaboration happens through patch review and discussion via email.

To use `git send-email`, you'll typically need to configure your email settings within your Git configuration. This includes specifying your SMTP server, email address, and authentication details. Once configured, you can use `git send-email <commit-range>` to prepare and send your commits as emails. For example, `git send-email HEAD~3..HEAD` will send the last three commits as individual emails. You can also use the `--to` flag to specify the recipient(s) of the email, such as `git send-email --to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org HEAD`.

Before sending, it's essential to ensure your commits are properly formatted and follow the project's contribution guidelines. This often includes adding a `Signed-off-by:` line to each commit message, indicating that you have the right to submit the patch under the project's license. Using `git format-patch` in conjunction with `git send-email` can be helpful for creating patches in the correct format before sending them.
