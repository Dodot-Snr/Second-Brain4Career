Code review is a critical practice in secure coding, involving the systematic examination of source code to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to secure coding standards. It's a collaborative process where developers scrutinize each other's code, looking for flaws that could be exploited by attackers. This proactive approach helps catch vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later. Effective code reviews go beyond just functionality; they focus on identifying common security weaknesses like injection flaws, broken authentication, and cross-site scripting (XSS).

A key aspect of security-focused code review is understanding common vulnerability patterns. For example, reviewers should be vigilant for instances where user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, which could lead to SQL injection attacks. Another example is looking for hardcoded credentials or API keys within the codebase, which can be easily compromised if the code is exposed. By focusing on these and other common vulnerabilities, code reviews become a powerful tool for building more secure and resilient applications.

```python
# Example of potential SQL injection vulnerability
def get_user(username):
  query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'"
  # Execute the query (vulnerable to SQL injection)
```

In this example, a code reviewer should flag the direct concatenation of the `username` variable into the SQL query. A safer approach would involve using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
