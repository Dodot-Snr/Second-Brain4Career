Submitting patches to the Linux kernel is a crucial part of contributing to its development. The process involves formatting your changes into a patch file, ensuring it adheres to the kernel's coding style, and then sending it to the appropriate mailing list for review. This process is highly structured to maintain code quality and ensure that changes are properly vetted before being integrated into the kernel. The `git format-patch` command is commonly used to generate patch files from your commits.

The typical workflow involves creating a branch with your changes, committing them with clear and concise commit messages (following the kernel's commit message guidelines), and then using `git format-patch` to create the patch files. These patch files are then sent to the relevant mailing list using a tool like `git send-email` or a dedicated email client. For example, if you're submitting a patch to the networking subsystem, you would send it to the netdev mailing list. Remember to include a `Subject` line that clearly describes the patch and includes the `[PATCH]` tag.

A key example is submitting a fix for a bug in the ext4 filesystem. You would first identify the bug, create a branch, implement the fix, and then generate a patch using `git format-patch -1`. The resulting patch file would then be emailed to the ext4 mailing list, typically with a subject line like `[PATCH] ext4: Fix potential deadlock in journal replay`. The patch will then be reviewed by maintainers and other developers, and feedback will be provided. You may need to revise and resubmit the patch based on this feedback.
