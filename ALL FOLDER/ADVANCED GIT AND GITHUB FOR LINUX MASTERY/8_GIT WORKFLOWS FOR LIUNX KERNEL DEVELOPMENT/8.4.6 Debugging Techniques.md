Debugging the Linux kernel requires a different skillset and toolset than debugging user-space applications. Due to the kernel's privileged nature and direct interaction with hardware, errors can have system-wide consequences. This section introduces essential debugging techniques used in kernel development, focusing on methods for identifying and resolving issues within the kernel code.

Common debugging techniques include using `printk` for logging information, which allows developers to trace the execution flow and inspect variable values. For example, `printk(KERN_INFO "Value of my_variable: %d\n", my_variable);` will print the value of `my_variable` to the kernel log. More advanced techniques involve using kernel debuggers like GDB with KGDB or using tools like SystemTap and perf for dynamic tracing and performance analysis. These tools allow for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and examining the kernel's state in real-time.

Another crucial technique is using kernel oops messages and stack traces. When the kernel encounters an error, it often prints an "oops" message containing valuable information about the error, including the instruction pointer (IP) and the call stack. Analyzing these stack traces helps pinpoint the exact location in the code where the error occurred, providing crucial context for debugging.
