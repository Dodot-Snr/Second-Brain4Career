Working with the Linux kernel often involves submitting changes as a series of patches. Managing these patch series effectively is crucial for a smooth contribution process. This involves creating, organizing, reviewing, and submitting your changes in a way that is easy for maintainers to understand and integrate. Tools like `git format-patch`, `git am`, and `git send-email` become essential for generating and handling these patch series. Understanding how to properly format your patches, including adding necessary metadata like `Signed-off-by:` lines, is also vital.

A typical workflow involves creating a branch for your changes, making a series of commits, and then using `git format-patch` to generate individual patch files. For example, `git format-patch -s -M origin/master` will create a series of patches from your current branch relative to `origin/master`, including `Signed-off-by:` lines and detecting file renames. These patches can then be sent to a mailing list for review. Conversely, you might receive a patch series via email and use `git am` to apply them to your local branch for testing and review. For example, `git am < patch_series.mbox` will apply all patches found in the `patch_series.mbox` file.
