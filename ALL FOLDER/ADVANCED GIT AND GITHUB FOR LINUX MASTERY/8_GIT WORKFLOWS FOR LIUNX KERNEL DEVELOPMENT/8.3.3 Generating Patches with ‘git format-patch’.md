When contributing to the Linux kernel (or other projects that prefer patch-based workflows), you'll often need to generate patch files. `git format-patch` is the go-to command for this. It takes a range of commits and outputs each commit as a separate `.patch` file, formatted in a way that's easily understood and applied by tools like `git apply` or `patch`. These patch files contain the commit message, author information, and the diff itself, making them self-contained units of change.

The basic usage is `git format-patch <commit-range>`. For example, to generate patches for all commits since the `origin/main` branch, you would use `git format-patch origin/main`. This will create a series of `.patch` files in your current directory, named sequentially (e.g., `0001-Fix-typo-in-documentation.patch`, `0002-Add-new-feature.patch`). You can then send these patch files to the appropriate mailing list or maintainer for review and inclusion.

A common scenario is generating a patch for the last commit. You can achieve this with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`. This creates a single patch file representing the most recent commit. Another useful option is `--cover-letter`, which generates an additional patch file (named `0000-cover-letter.patch`) containing a summary of the changes and any additional context you want to provide to the reviewers.

```bash
git format-patch origin/main --cover-letter
```

This command generates all patches since the `origin/main` branch and includes a cover letter.
