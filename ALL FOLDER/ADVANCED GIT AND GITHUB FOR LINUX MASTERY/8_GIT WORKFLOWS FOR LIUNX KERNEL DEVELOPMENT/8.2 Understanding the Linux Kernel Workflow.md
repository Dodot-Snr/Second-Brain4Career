The Linux kernel development workflow is a highly structured and collaborative process, relying heavily on Git and mailing lists. Understanding this workflow is crucial for anyone contributing to the kernel, as it dictates how changes are proposed, reviewed, and ultimately integrated into the mainline kernel. The process generally involves submitting patches (changesets) via email to relevant mailing lists, where maintainers and other developers review the code, provide feedback, and suggest improvements. This iterative review process ensures code quality and adherence to kernel coding standards.

A key aspect of the workflow is the use of "patch series," which are collections of related patches that address a specific feature or bug fix. These series are often organized in a logical order, with each patch building upon the previous one. Another important element is the role of maintainers, who are responsible for specific subsystems or areas of the kernel. They act as gatekeepers, reviewing and accepting patches for their respective areas. For example, the networking subsystem has its own maintainers who oversee changes related to network drivers, protocols, and infrastructure.

For example, if you wanted to add a new device driver, you would first develop the driver and create a patch series. You would then submit this series to the appropriate mailing list (likely related to the device type or subsystem). The maintainers and other developers would review your code, and you would address their feedback by revising the patches and resubmitting them. This process continues until the maintainers are satisfied with the code and accept it into their Git repository, which will eventually be merged into the mainline kernel.
