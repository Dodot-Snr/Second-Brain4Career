The Linux kernel development workflow heavily relies on mailing lists for communication, code review, and patch submission. Unlike many modern projects that use pull requests on platforms like GitHub, kernel development primarily occurs through email exchanges. Developers submit patches as email attachments to specific mailing lists dedicated to different kernel subsystems. This approach fosters open discussion and allows a wider audience to participate in the review process, including those who may not be active GitHub users.

The process typically involves a developer creating a patch using `git format-patch`, which generates a series of email-friendly patch files. These patches are then sent to the relevant mailing list. Other developers review the patches, providing feedback directly via email replies. This feedback can range from minor style suggestions to significant architectural concerns. The original author then revises the patch based on the feedback and resubmits it, continuing the cycle until the patch is deemed acceptable.

A key example is the `linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org` mailing list, which serves as a general discussion forum for kernel development. Subsystem-specific lists, like `netdev@vger.kernel.org` for networking-related code, are also crucial. Another example is the use of `git send-email` to properly format and send patches directly from the command line, ensuring they are correctly interpreted by the mailing list software. This method preserves the patch's integrity and allows reviewers to easily apply the changes.
