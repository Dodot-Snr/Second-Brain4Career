Output encoding is a crucial secure coding practice that focuses on sanitizing data before it's displayed to users or used in other systems. The goal is to prevent various injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and command injection, by ensuring that potentially malicious characters are properly escaped or transformed into a safe representation. Without proper output encoding, user-supplied data or data retrieved from external sources can be misinterpreted by the receiving system, leading to security vulnerabilities.

Essentially, output encoding translates potentially dangerous characters into a safe format that the output context (e.g., HTML, URL, command line) can understand without executing them as code. For example, if a user enters `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` into a form field, proper HTML encoding would transform the `<` and `>` characters into `&lt;` and `&gt;`, respectively, preventing the browser from executing the JavaScript code. Similarly, when constructing shell commands, encoding user input prevents command injection.

Consider a scenario where you're building a script that displays a filename provided by the user. Without encoding, a malicious user could input `; rm -rf /`, which, if directly passed to the shell, could wipe out your entire system. By properly encoding the filename before passing it to the shell, you can prevent this catastrophic outcome. Another example is URL encoding, where spaces are replaced with `%20` and other special characters are encoded to ensure the URL is correctly interpreted by the browser and server.
