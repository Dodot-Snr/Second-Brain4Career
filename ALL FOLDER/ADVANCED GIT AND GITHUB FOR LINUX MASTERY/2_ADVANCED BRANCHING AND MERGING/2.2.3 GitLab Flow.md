GitLab Flow is a branching strategy that provides a structured and efficient workflow for software development, particularly well-suited for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) environments. It's designed to be more flexible than Gitflow, offering variations to accommodate different release cadences and project complexities. The core principle revolves around using feature branches for development, a `main` branch reflecting the production-ready state, and optional environment branches like `pre-production` or `staging` for testing.

A typical GitLab Flow involves creating a feature branch from `main` for each new feature or bug fix. Once the work is complete, a merge request (pull request in GitHub terminology) is created targeting `main`. This triggers automated testing and code review. After approval, the feature branch is merged into `main`. For projects with multiple environments, changes are then merged from `main` into environment branches like `pre-production` for further testing before finally deploying to production. For example, if a bug is found in `pre-production`, a branch can be created from `pre-production`, the fix implemented, and then merged back into `pre-production` and subsequently `main`.

GitLab Flow also supports release branches for projects with scheduled releases. In this scenario, a release branch is created from `main` at a specific point in time. Bug fixes specific to that release are made on the release branch and then merged back into both the release branch and `main`. This ensures that the `main` branch always contains the latest features and bug fixes, while the release branch provides a stable base for the upcoming release. This approach allows for hotfixes to be applied to older releases without disrupting the development of new features on `main`.
