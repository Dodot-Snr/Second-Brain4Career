Git's configuration system allows you to customize its behavior at different levels, offering flexibility but also requiring an understanding of precedence. When a setting is defined in multiple configuration files, Git follows a specific order to determine which value to use. This order, from highest to lowest precedence, is: `--local` (repository-specific), `--global` (user-specific), and `--system` (system-wide). Command-line options always override any configuration file settings.

Understanding this precedence is crucial for troubleshooting unexpected Git behavior. For example, if you set `user.name` globally but find that commits in a specific repository are using a different name, it's likely that the repository has a local `user.name` setting overriding the global one. You can check the local configuration using `git config --local user.name`. Similarly, a system-wide setting might be unintentionally affecting all your repositories.

Consider this scenario: You set `core.editor` to `nano` globally using `git config --global core.editor nano`. However, in a particular project, you want to use `vim`. You can override the global setting for that project by running `git config --local core.editor vim` within the project's directory. Now, when you run `git commit` in that project, Git will use `vim` as the editor, while other projects will still use `nano`.
