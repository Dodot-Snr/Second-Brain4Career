Interactive rebasing takes the power of `git rebase` to the next level, allowing you to not only move commits but also to edit, reorder, squash, or even drop them entirely. This provides granular control over your commit history, making it cleaner and more understandable. It's a powerful tool for preparing a feature branch for merging or for cleaning up a messy local history before sharing it.

To initiate an interactive rebase, use the command `git rebase -i <commit>`, where `<commit>` is the commit _before_ the first commit you want to modify. Git will then open an editor with a list of commits, each prefixed with a command like `pick`. By changing these commands, you can manipulate your commit history. For example, changing `pick` to `reword` allows you to edit the commit message, while `squash` merges the commit into the previous one.

A common use case is to combine several small, related commits into a single, more meaningful commit. Imagine you have three commits: "Fix typo," "Add missing semicolon," and "Implement feature X." You could use interactive rebasing to squash the first two commits into the third, resulting in a single commit: "Implement feature X (with typo fix and semicolon added)." Another example is to reorder commits to improve the logical flow of the history, making it easier for others to understand the changes.
