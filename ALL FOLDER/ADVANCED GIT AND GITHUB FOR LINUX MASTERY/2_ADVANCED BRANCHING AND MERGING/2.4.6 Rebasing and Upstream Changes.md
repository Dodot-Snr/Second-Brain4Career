Rebasing becomes particularly powerful when dealing with upstream changes in a forked repository. When you're working on a feature branch based on an older version of the upstream repository, your branch can quickly diverge. This divergence makes merging your changes back upstream more complex and prone to conflicts. Rebasing allows you to bring your feature branch up-to-date with the latest changes from the upstream repository before submitting a pull request. This results in a cleaner history and simplifies the integration process for the upstream maintainers.

The process typically involves adding the upstream repository as a remote to your local repository. Then, you fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository and rebase your feature branch onto the upstream's `main` or `master` branch. For example, if your feature branch is named `my-feature` and the upstream repository is named `upstream`, you would first fetch the upstream changes using `git fetch upstream`. Then, you would rebase your branch using `git rebase upstream/main`. This replays your commits on top of the latest `main` branch from the upstream repository.

However, be cautious when rebasing branches that have already been pushed to a remote repository, especially if others are collaborating on the same branch. Rebasing rewrites the commit history, which can cause significant issues for collaborators. In such cases, merging is generally a safer option. If you are the sole user of the branch, force-pushing after rebasing (`git push --force-with-lease`) might be necessary to update the remote branch with the rewritten history.
