Rebasing, while powerful, can sometimes lead to a messy or broken state, often referred to as a "bad rebase." This typically happens when conflicts arise during the rebase process that are not resolved correctly, or when the rebase is aborted prematurely, leaving your branch in a detached HEAD state or with a corrupted history. Fortunately, Git provides several mechanisms to recover from such situations.

The most common and straightforward method is using `git rebase --abort`. This command will immediately halt the rebase process and return your branch to the state it was in before you initiated the rebase. This is particularly useful if you realize early on that the rebase is going awry. Another approach, especially if you've already made some conflict resolutions but want to start over, is to use `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD`. `ORIG_HEAD` is a special ref that Git automatically updates to point to the branch's HEAD before you started the rebase. This effectively undoes all the changes made during the rebase attempt.

For example, imagine you started a rebase with `git rebase main` and encountered numerous conflicts you couldn't resolve. Running `git rebase --abort` would bring you back to your branch's state before you ran `git rebase main`. Alternatively, if you had already resolved some conflicts but wanted to discard them and start fresh, `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` would achieve the same result, discarding the partially resolved rebase state. Understanding these recovery methods is crucial for confidently using rebasing in your workflow.
