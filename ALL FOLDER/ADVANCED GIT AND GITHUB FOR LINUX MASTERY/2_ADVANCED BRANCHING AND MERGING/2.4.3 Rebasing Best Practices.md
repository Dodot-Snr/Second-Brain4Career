Rebasing, while powerful, can also be dangerous if not handled carefully. Following best practices minimizes the risk of data loss and ensures a clean, understandable project history. The core principle is to **avoid rebasing public branches**. Rebasing rewrites history, and if others have based their work on the original commits, rebasing will create significant merge conflicts and confusion. Only rebase branches that are local to your machine or branches specifically designated for rebasing (e.g., feature branches before merging into `develop`).

A common scenario is rebasing a feature branch onto the `develop` branch before creating a pull request. This ensures your changes are based on the latest `develop` and results in a cleaner, linear history. For example, after working on a feature branch `my-feature`, you would run `git rebase develop` while on the `my-feature` branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise during the rebase process. Another best practice is to frequently commit small, logical changes to your feature branch. This makes rebasing and conflict resolution easier to manage.

Always remember to test your changes thoroughly after rebasing. Rebasing effectively creates new commits, so it's crucial to ensure that the rebased branch functions as expected. If you encounter significant issues or are unsure about the rebasing process, consider using `git rebase --abort` to revert to the state before the rebase.
