Beyond basic merges, Git offers powerful techniques to handle complex scenarios and maintain a clean project history. Advanced merging involves strategies like using merge strategies, resolving complex conflicts, and employing techniques like cherry-picking and rebasing (though rebasing is often considered an alternative to merging, it's crucial to understand its impact on the commit history). These techniques are essential for collaborative projects where multiple developers are working on the same codebase simultaneously.

One key aspect is understanding different merge strategies. For example, the `recursive` strategy (the default) is excellent for most merges, but the `ours` strategy can be useful when you want to ignore changes from a branch entirely. Another example is resolving complex conflicts. When Git can't automatically determine how to combine changes, it marks the conflicting sections in the affected files. You'll need to manually edit these files, choosing which changes to keep or combining them as needed. Tools like `git mergetool` can assist in visualizing and resolving these conflicts.

Finally, cherry-picking allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them to another. This is useful for incorporating bug fixes or features without merging the entire branch. For example, if a critical bug fix is committed to a development branch, you can cherry-pick that commit into the main branch to quickly address the issue.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
