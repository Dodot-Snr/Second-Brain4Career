Rebasing and merging are both fundamental Git operations used to integrate changes from one branch into another. While they achieve the same outcome – incorporating new code – they differ significantly in how they rewrite history and impact the commit graph. Understanding these differences is crucial for maintaining a clean and understandable project history, especially in collaborative environments. Rebasing essentially replays your commits on top of the target branch, creating a linear history, while merging creates a merge commit that explicitly joins the two branches.

The key difference lies in the history. Rebasing rewrites the commit history of your feature branch, making it appear as if you branched off the target branch more recently. This results in a cleaner, linear history, which can be easier to follow. However, it also means that the commit SHAs of your feature branch will change. Merging, on the other hand, preserves the history of both branches, creating a merge commit to represent the integration. This approach maintains a more accurate record of when and how changes were integrated, but can lead to a more complex and branching history.

For example, imagine you have a feature branch `feature-x` branched off `main`. While you're working on `feature-x`, `main` receives several updates. If you rebase `feature-x` onto `main`, your `feature-x` commits will be replayed on top of the latest `main` commits, creating a linear history. If you merge `main` into `feature-x`, a merge commit will be created on `feature-x` to integrate the changes from `main`, preserving the history of both branches. The choice between rebasing and merging depends on your team's workflow and preferences regarding history management.
