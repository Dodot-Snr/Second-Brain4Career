GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow optimized for teams that deploy regularly. It's a simplified version of Gitflow, focusing on continuous integration and delivery. The core principle is that everything in the `main` branch is always deployable. To work on a new feature, fix a bug, or experiment with an idea, you create a new branch off `main`. This branch should be named descriptively, reflecting the purpose of the changes (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`, `bugfix/resolve-login-error`).

The workflow revolves around creating pull requests (PRs). Once you've made changes on your feature branch, you open a PR against `main`. This allows for code review, discussion, and automated testing. The PR serves as a central point for collaboration and ensures that all changes are thoroughly vetted before being merged into the main codebase. After the PR is approved and all tests pass, the branch is merged into `main` and immediately deployed.

For example, imagine you're adding a new search feature. You'd create a branch called `feature/search-functionality`. After implementing the feature and writing tests, you'd open a PR. If a reviewer suggests changes, you'd commit those changes to the same branch, automatically updating the PR. Once approved, you merge `feature/search-functionality` into `main` and deploy. If a bug is found in production, you create a new branch from `main` (e.g., `bugfix/search-results-incorrect`), fix the bug, open a PR, and repeat the process.
