Rebasing is a powerful Git technique used to integrate changes from one branch into another. Unlike merging, which creates a new merge commit, rebasing rewrites the commit history of the target branch to appear as if it branched off from the latest commit of the base branch. This results in a cleaner, linear history, making it easier to understand the project's evolution. However, it's crucial to understand the implications of rewriting history, especially when working collaboratively.

The primary use case for rebasing is to keep feature branches up-to-date with the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`). For example, if you've been working on a feature branch for a week, and `main` has seen several updates, rebasing your feature branch onto `main` will incorporate those changes into your feature branch's history. This helps avoid large, complex merge commits later on and reduces the likelihood of integration issues when you eventually merge your feature branch back into `main`.

Here's a basic example: Suppose you're on your `feature/new-feature` branch and want to rebase it onto `main`. You would first switch to your feature branch and then run `git rebase main`. Git will then apply each commit from your feature branch onto the tip of the `main` branch. If conflicts arise during the rebase, you'll need to resolve them before continuing the rebase process using `git add <resolved_file>` and `git rebase --continue`. If you need to abort the rebase, you can use `git rebase --abort`.
