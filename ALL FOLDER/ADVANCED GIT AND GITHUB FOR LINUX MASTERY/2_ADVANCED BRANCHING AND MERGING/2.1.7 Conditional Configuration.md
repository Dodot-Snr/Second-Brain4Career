Conditional configuration in Git allows you to apply specific settings based on certain conditions, such as the directory you're currently working in. This is incredibly useful when you have different projects with varying requirements, like different email addresses for work and personal projects, or different commit signing keys. Instead of manually changing your Git configuration every time you switch projects, conditional includes automate the process.

Git achieves this through the `includeIf` directive in your `.gitconfig` file. This directive specifies a condition, and if that condition is met, it includes another configuration file. For example, you might have a separate configuration file for your work projects located in a specific directory.

Here's an example of how to set up conditional configuration:

```
[includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
  path = ~/.gitconfig-work
```

This snippet tells Git that if the current directory is within `~/work/`, it should include the configuration file `~/.gitconfig-work`. This file can then contain settings specific to your work projects, such as your work email address and signing key. Another common use case is to configure different line ending behaviors based on the project.
