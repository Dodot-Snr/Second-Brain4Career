Gitflow is a highly structured branching model designed for managing larger projects with scheduled releases. It revolves around the use of specific branches with defined purposes and lifecycles. The core branches are `main` (representing production-ready code), `develop` (integrating features for the next release), `feature` branches (for individual features), `release` branches (preparing a release), and `hotfix` branches (addressing critical bugs in production). This model provides a clear framework for parallel development, release management, and bug fixing.

The typical Gitflow workflow involves creating `feature` branches from `develop` for new features. Once a feature is complete, it's merged back into `develop`. When the `develop` branch is ready for a release, a `release` branch is created from it. This branch allows for final testing and bug fixes before merging into both `main` (tagged with the release version) and `develop`. If a critical bug is found in `main`, a `hotfix` branch is created from `main`, the fix is applied, and then merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

For example, imagine you're adding a new user authentication system. You'd create a `feature/user-auth` branch from `develop`, implement the feature, and then merge it back into `develop`. Later, when preparing for version 2.0, you'd create a `release/2.0` branch from `develop`, perform final testing, and then merge it into both `main` and `develop` after tagging `main` with `v2.0`.
