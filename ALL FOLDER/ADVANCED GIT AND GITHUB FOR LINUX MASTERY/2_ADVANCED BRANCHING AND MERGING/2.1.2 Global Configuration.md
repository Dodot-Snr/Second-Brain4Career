Global configuration in Git allows you to set options that apply to all repositories on your system for a specific user. This is useful for setting your name, email, default editor, and other preferences that you want to use across all your Git projects. These settings are stored in the `.gitconfig` file located in your home directory (e.g., `~/.gitconfig` on Linux/macOS).

Configuring Git globally saves you from having to set the same options repeatedly for each new repository you create or clone. It provides a convenient way to establish a consistent Git environment. Global settings are overridden by local (repository-specific) settings if there are conflicts, providing flexibility when you need different configurations for particular projects.

For example, to set your global username and email, you would use the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Another common global configuration is setting your preferred text editor for commit messages:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```
