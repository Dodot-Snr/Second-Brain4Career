Rebasing becomes significantly more powerful (and complex!) when dealing with multiple branches. Instead of just rebasing a single branch onto another, you might need to rebase a feature branch onto an updated `develop` branch, which itself has been rebased onto `main`. This scenario often arises in collaborative projects where multiple developers are working on different features simultaneously. The goal is to maintain a clean and linear project history, avoiding unnecessary merge commits and making it easier to understand the evolution of the codebase.

When rebasing multiple branches, it's crucial to understand the order of operations. Typically, you'll want to rebase the branch closest to `main` first, and then rebase subsequent branches onto the updated branch. For example, if you have `feature-A` branched off `develop`, and `develop` branched off `main`, you'd first rebase `develop` onto `main`, and then rebase `feature-A` onto the newly rebased `develop`. This ensures that `feature-A` incorporates all the latest changes from both `main` and `develop`.

A common example is when `develop` has diverged significantly from `main` due to hotfixes being applied directly to `main`. To integrate these hotfixes into `develop` and subsequently into `feature-A`, you would:

1. `git checkout develop`
2. `git rebase main`
3. `git checkout feature-A`
4. `git rebase develop`

This process ensures that `feature-A` is built on top of the most up-to-date version of both `main` and `develop`, minimizing conflicts and maintaining a clean history. Remember to handle conflicts carefully during each rebase step.
