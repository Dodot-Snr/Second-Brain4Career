System-level Git configuration applies to all users on a given machine. This is the broadest scope of Git configuration and is typically managed by system administrators. Settings defined here override the global configuration but are overridden by user-specific and repository-specific configurations. The system configuration file is usually located at `/etc/gitconfig` on Linux systems.

Modifying the system configuration requires root privileges. This level of configuration is useful for enforcing certain standards across an entire organization or development environment. For example, you might set a default editor for all users or enforce a specific commit message format.

A common example is setting the default editor for all users on the system:

```bash
sudo git config --system core.editor vim
```

Another example might be setting a default merge tool:

```bash
sudo git config --system merge.tool kdiff3
```

Remember that changes made at the system level affect everyone using Git on that machine, so exercise caution and communicate changes effectively.
