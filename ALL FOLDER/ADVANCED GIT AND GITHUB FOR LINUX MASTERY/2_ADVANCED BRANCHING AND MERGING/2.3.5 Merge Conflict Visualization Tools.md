When dealing with complex merge conflicts, understanding the changes and their origins becomes crucial. Merge conflict visualization tools provide a graphical representation of the conflicting files, highlighting the differences between branches and making it easier to resolve conflicts effectively. These tools go beyond the standard Git conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) by offering a side-by-side or unified diff view, often with features like syntax highlighting and the ability to directly edit the conflicting sections.

Several tools are available to aid in visualizing merge conflicts. Some popular options include:

- **Meld:** A visual diff and merge tool that allows you to compare files and directories side-by-side. It clearly highlights the differences and provides an intuitive interface for resolving conflicts. You can launch Meld from the command line using `git mergetool --tool=meld`.
    
- **VS Code with GitLens:** The VS Code editor, combined with the GitLens extension, offers powerful inline conflict resolution features. It visually highlights conflicting sections and allows you to accept changes from either branch or manually edit the merged result directly within the editor.
    

Using these tools can significantly reduce the time and effort required to resolve complex merge conflicts, leading to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
