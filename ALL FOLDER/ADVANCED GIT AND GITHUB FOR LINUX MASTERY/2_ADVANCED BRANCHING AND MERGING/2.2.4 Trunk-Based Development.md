Trunk-Based Development (TBD) is a source control branching model where developers commit directly to the `main` branch (also known as `trunk`). Instead of long-lived feature branches, changes are integrated frequently, often multiple times a day. This approach emphasizes small, incremental changes and continuous integration, reducing the risk of merge conflicts and promoting faster feedback loops. Feature toggles are often used to hide incomplete features from users until they are ready for release.

The core principle of TBD is to keep the `main` branch stable and deployable at all times. This requires a strong emphasis on automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. For example, a developer working on a new user authentication method would commit small, testable changes to `main` daily, using feature toggles to disable the new method until it's fully implemented and tested. Another example is refactoring a large codebase. Instead of a long-lived branch, the refactoring is broken down into small, manageable chunks, each committed to `main` after thorough testing.

TBD fosters collaboration and reduces the overhead associated with managing multiple long-lived branches. It encourages developers to think in terms of small, incremental improvements and to prioritize continuous integration and testing. While it requires a disciplined approach and robust CI/CD infrastructure, TBD can significantly improve development velocity and reduce the risk of integration issues.
