GitHub Actions provides a powerful and automated way to deploy your GitHub Pages site. Instead of manually building and pushing your site, you can configure a workflow that automatically builds and deploys your site whenever changes are pushed to your repository. This ensures that your live site is always up-to-date with the latest code. This is especially useful for static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby, which require a build process.

The core of deploying with GitHub Actions involves creating a YAML file (typically located in `.github/workflows/`) that defines the steps to be executed. This workflow will often include steps to checkout your code, install dependencies, build your site, and then deploy the generated files to the `gh-pages` branch (or the root of your repository if using a custom domain). The `actions/deploy-pages` action simplifies the deployment process.

For example, a simple workflow might look like this:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
        with:
          folder: dist # Or the directory where your built site is located
```
