GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can use GitHub Pages to host a website about yourself, your organization, or your project directly from a GitHub repository. It's a fantastic way to showcase your work, create project documentation, or even build a simple blog.

There are three main types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization sites. Project sites are connected to a specific project repository. User sites represent your personal website (e.g., `username.github.io`), and organization sites represent your organization's website (e.g., `organizationname.github.io`). The source files for these sites are typically stored in a dedicated branch (often `gh-pages`) or in the root directory of the `main` or `master` branch.

For example, if you have a project called "my-awesome-project" and you want to host its documentation on GitHub Pages, you could create a `gh-pages` branch in the "my-awesome-project" repository. Any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in that branch will be served as a website at `username.github.io/my-awesome-project`. Alternatively, you could use a static site generator like Jekyll. By placing Jekyll source files in the root of your `main` branch and enabling GitHub Pages, GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site.
