Environment variables are dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. In the context of GitHub Actions, they are crucial for storing and managing sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and other configuration settings that you don't want to hardcode directly into your workflow files. They allow you to customize your workflows without exposing secrets in your repository.

GitHub Actions provides several ways to define and use environment variables. You can define them at the workflow level, job level, or step level. Workflow-level variables are available to all jobs in the workflow, job-level variables are available to all steps within a specific job, and step-level variables are only available to the specific step where they are defined. This allows for granular control over the scope and visibility of your variables.

For example, you might define a secret API key as an environment variable named `API_KEY` in your repository settings. Then, in your workflow, you can access it using the `${{ secrets.API_KEY }}` syntax. Similarly, you can define custom environment variables directly in your workflow file:

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      MY_CUSTOM_VAR: "Hello, World!"
    steps:
      - name: Echo the variable
        run: echo $MY_CUSTOM_VAR
```
