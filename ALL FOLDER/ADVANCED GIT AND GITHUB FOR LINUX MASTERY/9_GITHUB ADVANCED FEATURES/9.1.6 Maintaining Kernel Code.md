Maintaining kernel code is a crucial aspect of contributing to the Linux kernel. It goes beyond simply submitting patches; it involves actively reviewing, testing, and integrating changes into specific subsystems or areas of the kernel. Maintainers are responsible for ensuring the quality and stability of their assigned code, acting as gatekeepers for new features and bug fixes. This role requires a deep understanding of the kernel's architecture, coding standards, and the specific functionality of the code they oversee.

A key responsibility of a kernel maintainer is patch review. This involves carefully examining submitted patches for correctness, style, and potential security vulnerabilities. For example, a maintainer for the networking subsystem might review a patch that adds a new network protocol, ensuring it adheres to the kernel's networking API and doesn't introduce any performance regressions. Another example is managing a specific driver. The maintainer would review patches related to that driver, ensuring compatibility with different hardware configurations and addressing any reported issues. They also play a vital role in resolving conflicts between different patches and guiding contributors through the development process.
