GitHub Actions provides a powerful automation engine that can be seamlessly integrated with GitHub Packages. This integration allows you to automate various aspects of your package management workflow, such as building, testing, and publishing packages whenever changes are pushed to your repository. By leveraging Actions, you can ensure that your packages are always up-to-date and readily available for consumption.

One common use case is automatically publishing a new version of your package to GitHub Packages whenever a new tag is created in your repository. For example, you could configure an Action to build your package, run tests, and then publish it to the appropriate registry (e.g., npm, Maven, NuGet) using the tag name as the package version. This eliminates the need for manual publishing and ensures consistency across your releases.

Another example is using GitHub Actions to automatically build and test your package on different operating systems or architectures. This can be particularly useful for ensuring that your package is compatible with a wide range of environments. You can define a workflow that builds your package on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and then runs a suite of tests to verify its functionality. If any of the tests fail, the Action will fail, preventing the package from being published with potential issues.
