GitHub Pages automatically serves your website over HTTPS, ensuring secure connections for your visitors. This is a crucial aspect of modern web development, providing encryption and protecting data transmitted between the server and the user's browser. While GitHub handles the core HTTPS setup, understanding the underlying principles and potential configuration options is important for advanced users.

By default, GitHub Pages uses a Let's Encrypt certificate for your custom domain (if you have one). This certificate is automatically renewed, so you don't have to worry about manual renewals. However, you might need to configure your DNS settings correctly to point your domain to GitHub's servers. For example, you'll need to create an `A` record pointing to GitHub's IP addresses and a `CNAME` record pointing to your GitHub Pages subdomain (e.g., `yourusername.github.io`).

If you encounter issues with HTTPS, such as mixed content warnings (where some resources are loaded over HTTP while the page is served over HTTPS), you'll need to ensure all your website's assets (images, scripts, stylesheets) are loaded over HTTPS. You can achieve this by updating your HTML to use HTTPS URLs for all resources. For example, change `<img src="http://example.com/image.jpg">` to `<img src="https://example.com/image.jpg">`. GitHub provides tools and documentation to help diagnose and resolve common HTTPS-related problems.
