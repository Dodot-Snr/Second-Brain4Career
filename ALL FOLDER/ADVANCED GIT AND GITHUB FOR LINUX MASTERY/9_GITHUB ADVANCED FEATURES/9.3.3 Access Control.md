Access control for GitHub Packages allows you to manage who can access and download your packages. This is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your software, especially when dealing with private or proprietary code. You can control access at different levels, including repository-level and organization-level permissions. This ensures that only authorized users or teams can install and use your packages.

GitHub Packages inherit the visibility and permissions of the repository they are published in. For example, if a repository is private, only users with access to that repository can access the packages within it. You can also grant specific permissions to users or teams, allowing them to read, write, or administer packages. This granular control is essential for collaborative projects where different team members have different responsibilities.

For instance, you might grant "read" access to a specific team so they can download and use a package in their projects, while restricting "write" access to a smaller group responsible for maintaining and updating the package. Another example is using GitHub Actions workflows to automatically publish packages, where the workflow needs "write" access to the package registry.
