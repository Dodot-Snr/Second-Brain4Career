GitHub Packages allows you to host software packages directly in your GitHub repository, alongside your source code. This section focuses on how to publish your own packages to GitHub Packages and how to consume packages that others have published. Publishing involves configuring your project to authenticate with GitHub Packages, building your package, and then pushing it to the appropriate registry. Consuming packages involves adding the GitHub Packages registry to your package manager's configuration and then installing the desired package as you normally would.

A key example of publishing is with a Node.js package. You would first need to authenticate with GitHub Packages using a personal access token (PAT) with the `write:packages` scope. Then, you would modify your `package.json` file to include the GitHub repository URL as the package's repository and publish it using `npm publish`. On the consumption side, you would configure your `.npmrc` file to point to the GitHub Packages registry and then install the package using `npm install @your-github-username/your-package-name`.

Another example is with a Debian package. You would build your `.deb` package as usual, then use `gh` cli to upload the package to GitHub Packages. For example:

```bash
gh package upload --owner your-github-username deb your-package.deb
```

To consume the package, you would add the GitHub Packages repository to your APT sources list and then install the package using `apt install your-package-name`.
