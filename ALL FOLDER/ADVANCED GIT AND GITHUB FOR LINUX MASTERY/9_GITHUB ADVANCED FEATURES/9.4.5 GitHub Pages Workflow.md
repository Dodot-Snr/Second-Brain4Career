The GitHub Pages workflow outlines the process of deploying static websites directly from your GitHub repository. It leverages Git for version control and GitHub's infrastructure for hosting. The typical workflow involves creating a dedicated branch (often `gh-pages` or `main`/`master` with a `/docs` folder) or using the root directory of your repository, committing your website's files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images), and pushing the changes to GitHub. GitHub then automatically builds and deploys your website, making it accessible via a unique URL (e.g., `your-username.github.io/your-repository`).

A common example is creating a personal portfolio website. You would design your website locally, commit the files to a repository named `your-username.github.io`, and push it to GitHub. GitHub Pages would then automatically deploy your website to `your-username.github.io`. Another example involves documenting a software project. You might store the documentation in a `/docs` folder on the `main` branch. By configuring GitHub Pages to use this folder, your project's documentation becomes readily available online. This streamlined process simplifies website deployment and maintenance, making it ideal for static content.
