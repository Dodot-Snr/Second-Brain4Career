When contributing to the Linux kernel, or any large open-source project, writing clear and concise commit messages is paramount. These messages serve as a historical record, explaining the _why_ behind the changes, not just the _what_. A well-crafted commit message helps maintainers understand the context of your contribution, facilitates code review, and aids in debugging future issues. Think of your commit message as a mini-documentation for your code change.

A good commit message typically follows a specific structure. The first line should be a concise summary of the change, ideally under 50 characters. This is followed by a blank line, and then a more detailed explanation of the commit. This explanation should describe the problem being solved, the approach taken, and any potential side effects. Referencing specific bug reports or kernel mailing list discussions is also helpful.

For example, consider a commit fixing a memory leak:

```
Fix: memory leak in network driver X

The network driver X was leaking memory when handling fragmented packets.
This commit addresses the issue by freeing the allocated memory buffer
after the packet has been processed.

Fixes: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12345
```

Another example, improving error handling:

```
Enhance: Improve error handling in filesystem Y

The filesystem Y lacked proper error handling for disk I/O errors.
This commit adds checks for I/O errors and returns appropriate error codes
to the caller, preventing potential data corruption.
