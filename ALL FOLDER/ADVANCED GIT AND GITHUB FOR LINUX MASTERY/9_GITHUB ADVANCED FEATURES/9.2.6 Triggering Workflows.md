Workflows in GitHub Actions are not just passively waiting to run. Understanding how to trigger them effectively is crucial for automating your development processes. Workflows can be triggered by a variety of events, including pushes to a repository, pull requests, scheduled events (cron jobs), manual triggers, and even webhooks from external services. This flexibility allows you to tailor your automation to precisely match your needs.

The most common trigger is a `push` event, which automatically runs a workflow whenever code is pushed to a specific branch. For example, you might configure a workflow to run tests every time code is pushed to the `main` branch. Another powerful trigger is the `pull_request` event, which allows you to run checks and validations on pull requests before they are merged. This can help ensure code quality and prevent integration issues.

Beyond these common triggers, you can also use `workflow_dispatch` to manually trigger a workflow from the GitHub UI or API, or `schedule` to run workflows on a cron schedule. For example, you could schedule a workflow to run nightly backups of your database. Understanding the different trigger options and how to configure them in your workflow YAML file is essential for maximizing the power of GitHub Actions.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:
```
