GitHub Pages provides a simple way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. While you can upload plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, using a static site generator (SSG) like Jekyll can significantly streamline the website creation and maintenance process. SSGs take source files written in a templating language (like Liquid for Jekyll) and generate static HTML files, allowing you to use layouts, includes, and data-driven content without needing a server-side language. This approach offers benefits like improved performance, enhanced security, and easier content management.

Jekyll is particularly well-integrated with GitHub Pages. In fact, GitHub Pages natively supports Jekyll, meaning you can simply push your Jekyll project to a repository, and GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site. Other popular static site generators include Hugo, Gatsby, and Next.js. While GitHub Pages doesn't natively support all of them, you can still use them by generating the static HTML files locally and pushing those to your repository.

For example, with Jekyll, you can define a layout in `_layouts/default.html` and then reuse it across multiple pages. A simple layout might look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
  {{ content }}
</body>
</html>
```

Then, a page like `about.md` can use this layout:

```markdown
---
layout: default
title: About Us
---

# About Our Company

This is some information about our company.
```

Jekyll will then combine these files to generate the final `about.html` page. This modular approach makes managing larger websites much easier.
