Effectively monitoring and debugging your GitHub Actions workflows is crucial for ensuring their reliability and efficiency. GitHub provides several built-in tools and techniques to help you identify and resolve issues within your workflows. This includes real-time logs, workflow run summaries, and the ability to enable debug logging for more granular insights. Understanding how to leverage these features is essential for advanced Git and GitHub users.

One common debugging technique is using the `set-output` command with debug logging enabled. For example, you might want to inspect the value of a variable after a specific step. You can add a step that echoes the variable's value and sets it as an output, then enable debug logging in your repository settings. This will print the variable's value in the workflow logs, even if it's not normally visible.

Another powerful tool is the ability to re-run failed jobs with debugging enabled. This allows you to step through the workflow execution and examine the state of the environment at each step. For instance, if a script is failing, you can re-run the job with debugging and use `echo` statements or other debugging tools within the script to pinpoint the exact line causing the error. This iterative process of monitoring logs, enabling debugging, and re-running jobs is key to mastering GitHub Actions.
