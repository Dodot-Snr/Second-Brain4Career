GitHub Pages provides a simple and effective way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. While the default URL structure ([username.github.io/repository](http://username.github.io/repository)) is convenient, using a custom domain offers a more professional and branded online presence. This involves configuring your domain's DNS records to point to GitHub's servers, allowing visitors to access your website through your own domain name (e.g., [mywebsite.com](http://mywebsite.com)).

Setting up a custom domain typically involves adding a `CNAME` file to the root of your GitHub Pages repository containing your domain name. You then need to configure your domain registrar's DNS settings. This usually involves creating an `A` record pointing to GitHub's IP addresses (e.g., 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153) and optionally a `CNAME` record for the `www` subdomain pointing to your primary domain (e.g., `www.mywebsite.com` pointing to `mywebsite.com`).

For example, if you own the domain `example.com` and want to host your GitHub Pages site there, you would create a `CNAME` file in your repository containing `example.com`. Then, in your domain registrar's DNS settings, you'd create an `A` record for `@` (or leave the host field blank, depending on the registrar) pointing to GitHub's IP addresses and a `CNAME` record for `www` pointing to `example.com`. This allows users to access your site via both `example.com` and `www.example.com`.
