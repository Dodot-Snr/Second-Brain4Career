GitHub Pages provides a simple and effective way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. This is particularly useful for personal portfolios, project documentation, or simple landing pages. You can think of it as a free and convenient web hosting service tightly integrated with your Git workflow. The core idea is that GitHub automatically builds and deploys your website based on the files in a designated branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`) or a specific folder within your repository.

To create a static website, you'll typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can also leverage static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby to streamline the development process, especially for larger or more complex sites. These generators take markdown or other templating languages as input and output static HTML files, which are then hosted by GitHub Pages. For example, you might create a simple `index.html` file with some basic content and push it to your `main` branch. GitHub Pages will then serve this file as your website.

Another common example is using Jekyll. You can create a `_config.yml` file to configure your site, write content in Markdown files, and Jekyll will generate a complete static website that GitHub Pages can host. This allows you to manage your website content in a more organized and maintainable way.

```yaml
# _config.yml (Example Jekyll Configuration)
title: My Awesome Website
author: Your Name
```
