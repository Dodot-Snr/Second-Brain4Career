`git filter-branch` is a powerful, albeit complex, Git command used to rewrite the commit history of a repository. It allows you to modify a large number of commits based on specified filters. This can be useful for tasks like removing sensitive data (passwords, API keys), changing email addresses across the entire history, or restructuring the project's directory layout. However, it's crucial to understand that rewriting history changes the commit SHAs, effectively creating a new history. This can cause significant issues if others are collaborating on the same repository, as their local histories will diverge.

One common use case is removing a large file accidentally committed to the repository. For example, if you committed a multi-gigabyte file, you can use `git filter-branch` to remove it from all commits. Another example is changing the author's email address across the entire project history. This is often needed when a developer changes their email or when a company rebrands.

**Important Note:** Due to its complexity and potential for disruption, `git filter-branch` is generally discouraged in favor of more modern alternatives like `git filter-repo` (for single-repo operations) or specialized tools for specific tasks. Always back up your repository before using `git filter-branch`.
