Husky is a popular and powerful tool for managing Git hooks in your projects. It allows you to easily configure and run scripts automatically at various stages of the Git workflow, such as before committing, pushing, or merging. This helps enforce code quality, style guidelines, and other important checks, ensuring a consistent and reliable codebase. By automating these checks, Husky reduces the risk of human error and streamlines the development process.

Husky works by creating symbolic links from your project's `.git/hooks` directory to scripts defined in your `package.json` file (or a dedicated Husky configuration file). This means that when a Git event occurs (e.g., `git commit`), Git will execute the corresponding script. For example, you can use Husky to run linters like ESLint or Prettier before each commit, preventing code with syntax errors or style violations from being committed.

A common example is using Husky to run Prettier to automatically format code before each commit:

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "prettier --write ."
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Husky to run `prettier --write .` before every commit, automatically formatting all files in the project. Another example is running tests before pushing:

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-push": "npm test"
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that all tests pass before any code is pushed to a remote repository.
