Git attributes provide a powerful mechanism to control how Git handles specific files and directories within your repository. These attributes are defined in a `.gitattributes` file, which resides in the root of your repository or in any subdirectory. They allow you to customize aspects like line endings, diffing behavior, and even how Git stores files, all on a per-file or per-directory basis. This level of granularity is crucial for managing complex projects with diverse file types and platform-specific requirements.

By leveraging Git attributes, you can ensure consistency across different operating systems and development environments. For example, you can normalize line endings to prevent spurious diffs caused by Windows using CRLF and Linux using LF. You can also specify custom diff drivers for binary files, allowing you to compare versions based on metadata or extracted text instead of raw binary data. This is particularly useful for image files or other non-textual formats.

A common example is setting the `eol` attribute to `lf` to force all files to use Linux-style line endings:

```
*.txt eol=lf
*.sh eol=lf
```

Another example is defining a custom diff driver for `.docx` files, allowing you to compare the text content of Word documents:

```
*.docx diff=word
[diff "word"]
  binary = true
  textconv = antiword
```
