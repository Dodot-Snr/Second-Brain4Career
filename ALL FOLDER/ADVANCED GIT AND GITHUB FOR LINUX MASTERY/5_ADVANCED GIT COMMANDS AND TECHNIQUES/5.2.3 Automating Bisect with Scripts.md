While `git bisect` is powerful, manually marking commits as good or bad can be tedious, especially when the bug manifests in complex ways or requires extensive testing. Automating this process with scripts significantly speeds up the bisect process. The core idea is to create a script that automatically determines if a given commit exhibits the bug. This script should return an exit code of 0 if the commit is "good" (doesn't have the bug) and an exit code between 1 and 127 (excluding 125, which is reserved by `git bisect`) if the commit is "bad" (has the bug).

For example, imagine a bug that causes a specific test case to fail. You could write a script named `test.sh` that runs the test suite and checks for the failure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
make test
if grep -q "Test Failed" test_output.log; then
  exit 1 # Bad commit
else
  exit 0 # Good commit
fi
```

After making the script executable (`chmod +x test.sh`), you can start the bisect process and tell Git to use your script: `git bisect start; git bisect bad; git bisect good <good_commit>; git bisect run ./test.sh`. Git will then automatically check out commits and run your script, marking them as good or bad based on the script's exit code, until it identifies the commit that introduced the bug. This automation dramatically reduces the manual effort involved in bisecting.
