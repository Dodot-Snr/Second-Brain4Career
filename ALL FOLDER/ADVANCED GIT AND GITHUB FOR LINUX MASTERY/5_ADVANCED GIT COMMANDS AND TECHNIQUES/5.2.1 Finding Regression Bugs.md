Regression bugs are a common headache in software development. They occur when a previously working feature suddenly breaks due to a change introduced in a later commit. Manually sifting through hundreds or even thousands of commits to pinpoint the culprit can be incredibly time-consuming. This is where `git bisect` shines. It automates the process of binary search to efficiently identify the commit that introduced the regression.

The core idea is to tell `git bisect` a "good" commit (where the feature worked) and a "bad" commit (where the feature is broken). `git bisect` then checks out a commit in the middle of the range. You test if the bug exists in this commit. You mark it as "good" or "bad" accordingly. `git bisect` repeats this process, narrowing down the range until it isolates the exact commit that caused the regression.

For example, imagine a script that used to correctly calculate a value, but now returns an incorrect result. You know the script worked correctly in version `v1.0` (tagged as `good`) and is broken in the current version (tagged as `bad`). Using `git bisect`, you can quickly find the commit that introduced the error. Another example could be a performance regression. If your application used to run faster, but now runs slower, `git bisect` can help you find the commit that caused the performance degradation.
