Manually installing Git hooks across multiple repositories or for multiple developers can be tedious and error-prone. Automating hook installation ensures consistency and reduces the overhead of setting up new projects or onboarding team members. This involves using tools and techniques to automatically copy or link hook scripts into the `.git/hooks` directory of a repository when it's cloned or initialized. This ensures that the desired hooks are always present and active, enforcing coding standards and workflow rules.

Several methods exist for automating hook installation. One common approach is to include a script (e.g., a shell script or Python script) within the repository that, when executed, copies the hook scripts from a designated directory (e.g., `scripts/git-hooks`) to the `.git/hooks` directory. Another approach involves using a dedicated hook management tool like `husky` (for Node.js projects) or `pre-commit` (language-agnostic). These tools often provide features for managing dependencies, running linters, and enforcing code style guidelines.

For example, using a simple shell script, you might have a `install-hooks.sh` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOOKS_DIR=".git/hooks"
SOURCE_DIR="scripts/git-hooks"

mkdir -p "$HOOKS_DIR"

cp "$SOURCE_DIR"/* "$HOOKS_DIR"/

chmod +x "$HOOKS_DIR"/*

echo "Git hooks installed successfully!"
```

This script copies all files from the `scripts/git-hooks` directory to the `.git/hooks` directory and makes them executable. Developers can then run this script after cloning the repository to automatically install the hooks.
