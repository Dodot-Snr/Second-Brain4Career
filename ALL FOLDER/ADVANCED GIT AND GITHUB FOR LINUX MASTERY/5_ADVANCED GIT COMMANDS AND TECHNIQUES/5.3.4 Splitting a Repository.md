Splitting a repository involves extracting a specific subdirectory or set of files from a larger repository into a new, independent repository. This is often useful when a project has grown too large, contains unrelated components, or when you want to isolate a specific module for independent development and maintenance. While `git filter-branch` is a powerful tool for rewriting history, it can also be leveraged to achieve this split. However, be aware that `git filter-branch` rewrites history, so it's crucial to inform collaborators and coordinate the transition.

The core idea is to use `git filter-branch` to rewrite the history of the repository, keeping only the files and directories you want in the new repository. This involves specifying a filter that removes all other files from each commit. For example, if you want to extract a directory named `module_a`, you would use a command that removes everything _except_ `module_a`. This creates a new history containing only the relevant files, effectively splitting the repository.

A common example is splitting a monorepo into multiple microservices. Imagine a repository containing code for several services (e.g., `service_a`, `service_b`, `service_c`). To create a separate repository for `service_a`, you could use `git filter-branch` with the `--subdirectory-filter` option:

```bash
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter service_a -- --all
```

This command rewrites the history, making `service_a` the root directory of the new repository. After this, you can create a new remote repository and push the filtered history to it. Remember to inform your team about the change and the new location of the split-off code.
