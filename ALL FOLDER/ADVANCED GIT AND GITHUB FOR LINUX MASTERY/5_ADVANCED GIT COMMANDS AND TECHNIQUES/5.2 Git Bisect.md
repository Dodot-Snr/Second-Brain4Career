Git bisect is a powerful Git command used for debugging by automatically performing a binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug. It's particularly useful when you know a bug exists in the current version of your code, but you're unsure when it was introduced. Instead of manually checking each commit, `git bisect` automates the process, significantly reducing the time and effort required to pinpoint the problematic commit.

The process involves marking a "bad" commit (usually the current HEAD) and a "good" commit (a known commit where the bug didn't exist). Git then checks out a commit halfway between these two points. You test this commit, and mark it as either "good" or "bad". Git repeats this process, narrowing down the range until it identifies the exact commit that introduced the bug.

For example, let's say you discover a bug in your current code. You know that the code was working fine in version `v1.0`. You would start the bisect process with:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.0
```

Git will then checkout a commit and prompt you to test it. After testing, you'd use `git bisect good` or `git bisect bad` to indicate the status. Once the culprit commit is found, Git will display its hash and description. You can then use `git bisect reset` to return to your original branch.
