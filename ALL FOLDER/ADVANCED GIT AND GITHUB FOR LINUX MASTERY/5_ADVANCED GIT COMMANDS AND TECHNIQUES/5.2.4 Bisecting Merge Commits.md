When a bug is introduced through a merge commit, pinpointing the exact commit that introduced the issue can be tricky. Git bisect handles merge commits gracefully, allowing you to specify which parent of the merge commit should be considered "good" or "bad." This is crucial because the bug might have originated from either branch being merged.

During a bisect session involving a merge commit, Git will prompt you to choose which parent to follow. You'll see a message like "Bisecting: a new merge base was tested." You can then use `git bisect good <parent_number>` or `git bisect bad <parent_number>` to indicate which parent branch you want to continue bisecting along. For example, if the merge commit has two parents and you suspect the bug came from the second parent, you would use `git bisect bad 2`.

Consider a scenario where you merged a feature branch into your main branch, and a bug appeared after the merge. Running `git bisect` will eventually lead you to the merge commit. If you determine the bug was likely introduced in the feature branch, you'd use `git bisect bad 2` (assuming the feature branch was the second parent). Conversely, if you suspect the main branch, you'd use `git bisect bad 1`. This allows you to efficiently narrow down the source of the bug within the specific branch responsible.
