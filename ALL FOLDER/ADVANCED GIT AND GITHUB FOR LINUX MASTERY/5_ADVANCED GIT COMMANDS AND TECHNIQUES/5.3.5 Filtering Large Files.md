Sometimes, large files (like binaries, datasets, or carelessly added media) accidentally get committed to a Git repository, bloating its size and slowing down operations like cloning and fetching. While `git filter-branch` is generally discouraged for rewriting shared history, it can be a powerful tool for surgically removing these large files from your repository's history. This process involves rewriting every commit that contains the unwanted file, effectively removing it from the repository's history.

The core idea is to use `git filter-branch` with the `--index-filter` option, which allows you to modify the index (staging area) of each commit. Within this filter, you can use commands like `git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch <file>` to remove the large file from the index. For example, to remove a large file named `huge_data.dat` from the entire history, you would use:

```bash
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch huge_data.dat' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

After running this command, you'll need to force-push the rewritten history to your remote repository. Be extremely cautious when doing this, as it will rewrite the history for everyone who uses the repository. It's crucial to communicate this change to your team and ensure they understand how to update their local repositories. Remember to run `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` to clean up the repository after filtering.
