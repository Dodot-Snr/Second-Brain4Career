While `.gitattributes` files in specific directories allow for fine-grained control, sometimes you need to apply attributes across your entire repository. This is where the global `.gitattributes` file comes in. Located in your Git configuration directory (typically `~/.gitconfig`), this file lets you define attributes that apply to all files in all repositories you work with on your system. This is particularly useful for settings like line ending normalization or text encoding that you want to enforce consistently.

To configure global attributes, you'll need to edit the `core.attributesfile` setting in your Git configuration. This setting points to the location of your global `.gitattributes` file. Once configured, any attributes defined in this file will be applied unless overridden by a `.gitattributes` file in a specific repository or directory. For example, you might globally set all `.txt` files to be treated as text and normalized to LF line endings:

```
*.txt text eol=lf
```

Another common use case is to globally exclude certain file types from being tracked, such as temporary files created by your editor. For instance, to ignore all files ending in `~` (often used as backup files), you could add the following to your global `.gitattributes`:

```
*~ -export-ignore
```

Remember that global attributes are applied _before_ repository-specific attributes, so repository-specific settings will always take precedence. This allows you to maintain a consistent baseline while still allowing for project-specific customizations.
