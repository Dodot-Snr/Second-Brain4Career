Lefthook is a fast and powerful Git hook manager written in Go. It's designed to streamline the process of managing and executing Git hooks, ensuring code quality and consistency across your team. Unlike some other hook managers, Lefthook focuses on speed and simplicity, making it a great choice for projects of any size. It allows you to define your hooks in a `lefthook.yml` file, specifying which commands to run at different stages of the Git workflow (e.g., `pre-commit`, `pre-push`).

Lefthook supports various scripting languages and tools, allowing you to integrate linters, formatters, and testing frameworks seamlessly. For example, you can configure Lefthook to run `eslint` and `prettier` on your JavaScript files before each commit, automatically fixing formatting issues and catching potential errors. This helps maintain a clean and consistent codebase, reducing the likelihood of merge conflicts and improving overall code quality.

Here's a simple example of a `lefthook.yml` configuration that runs `eslint` on JavaScript files:

```yaml
pre-commit:
  commands:
    eslint:
      run: eslint {staged_files}
      glob: "*.js"
```

In this example, `eslint` will be executed on all staged JavaScript files before each commit. The `{staged_files}` placeholder is automatically replaced by Lefthook with the list of files that have been staged for commit.
