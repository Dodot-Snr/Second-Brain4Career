Git is primarily designed for tracking changes in text-based files. However, it can also handle binary files, although not as efficiently. By default, Git treats binary files as opaque blobs, meaning it doesn't attempt to track line-by-line changes. This can lead to large repository sizes if binary files are frequently modified, as each version is stored in full. Git attributes provide a mechanism to manage how Git handles binary files, allowing you to optimize storage and performance.

One common use case is to prevent Git from attempting to diff binary files, which is generally meaningless and computationally expensive. This can be achieved using the `binary` attribute. For example, adding `*.png binary` to your `.gitattributes` file tells Git to treat all `.png` files as binary. Another useful attribute is `diff=false`, which explicitly disables diff generation for specified file types. This is particularly helpful for large binary files that are rarely changed.

Another approach is to use Git Large File Storage (LFS) for managing large binary files. Git LFS replaces large files in your Git repository with text pointers, while storing the actual file content on a remote server. This keeps your repository small and efficient, while still allowing you to track changes to large binary assets. For example, you might use Git LFS for storing large audio files (`*.wav filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text`) or video files.
