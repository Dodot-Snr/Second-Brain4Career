Sometimes, you might need to correct author information in your Git history. This could be due to a typo in your email address, using a personal email instead of a work one, or needing to attribute commits to the correct person after a mistake. While rewriting history should be done with caution, `git filter-branch` provides a powerful way to achieve this. It allows you to iterate through each commit and modify the author name and email.

The core of changing author information with `git filter-branch` lies in using the `--commit-filter` option. This filter executes a shell command for each commit. Within this command, you can modify the `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`, and `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` environment variables. After modifying these variables, you can use `git commit-tree` to create a new commit with the updated information.

For example, to correct the author email for all commits, you could use the following command:

```bash
git filter-branch --commit-filter '
  if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "wrong@example.com" ];
  then
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="correct@example.com";
    git commit-tree "$@";
  else
    git commit-tree "$@";
  fi' HEAD
```

This command iterates through each commit, checks if the author email is "[wrong@example.com](mailto:wrong@example.com)", and if so, changes it to "[correct@example.com](mailto:correct@example.com)" before creating a new commit. Remember to exercise caution when using `git filter-branch`, as it rewrites history and can cause issues if others have based work on the original history. Always back up your repository before running such commands.
