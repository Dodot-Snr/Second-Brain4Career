Integrating Git hooks into your CI/CD pipeline automates code quality checks, security scans, and other essential tasks before code is merged or deployed. This proactive approach helps catch issues early, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or vulnerabilities into production. By leveraging hooks, you can enforce coding standards, run tests, and even automatically update documentation as part of your development workflow. This ensures consistency and reliability across your projects.

A common example is using a `pre-commit` hook to run linters and formatters on staged code. This ensures that all committed code adheres to the project's style guidelines. Another example is using a `pre-push` hook to run unit tests before pushing code to a remote repository. If the tests fail, the push is rejected, preventing broken code from being integrated into the main branch. This integration streamlines the development process and improves the overall quality of the codebase.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

echo "Running unit tests..."
pytest

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Unit tests failed. Aborting push."
  exit 1
fi

echo "All tests passed. Proceeding with push."
exit 0
```
