The core of `git bisect` lies in its interactive commands: `git bisect start`, `git bisect bad`, and `git bisect good`. These commands guide you through the process of identifying the commit that introduced a bug. `git bisect start` initializes the bisecting process. You then mark a known "bad" commit (where the bug exists) using `git bisect bad`. This is typically the current `HEAD` or a recent release. Next, you mark a known "good" commit (where the bug _doesn't_ exist) using `git bisect good`. This is usually an older commit that you know was working correctly.

After marking a good and bad commit, Git automatically checks out a commit halfway between the two. You then test this commit to see if the bug is present. If it is, you run `git bisect bad`. If it isn't, you run `git bisect good`. Git then checks out another commit based on your input, narrowing down the range. This process repeats until `git bisect` identifies the exact commit that introduced the bug.

For example, let's say you discover a bug in your current version. You know that version `v1.0` was working fine. You would use the following commands:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.0
```

Git will then checkout a commit and prompt you to test. After testing, you'll use `git bisect good` or `git bisect bad` as appropriate until the culprit commit is found.
