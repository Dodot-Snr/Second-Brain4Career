Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a critical set of strategies and technologies designed to prevent sensitive data from leaving an organization's control. In the context of Git and GitHub, DLP focuses on preventing accidental or malicious exposure of confidential information like API keys, passwords, internal code, or customer data within repositories. This is especially important in Linux environments where developers often work directly with configuration files and scripts that might contain sensitive information.

Effective DLP involves a multi-layered approach. This includes implementing pre-commit hooks that scan code for potential secrets before they are committed, utilizing GitHub's secret scanning features to identify exposed credentials in repositories, and establishing clear policies and training for developers on handling sensitive data. For example, a pre-commit hook could be configured to reject commits containing strings that match common API key patterns. Another example is using GitHub's secret scanning to automatically detect and alert administrators when a commit containing a known secret pattern is pushed to a repository.
