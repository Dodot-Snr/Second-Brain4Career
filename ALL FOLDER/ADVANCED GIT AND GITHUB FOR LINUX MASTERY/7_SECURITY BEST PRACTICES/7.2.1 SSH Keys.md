SSH keys provide a more secure and convenient way to authenticate to remote servers, including GitHub, compared to password-based authentication. Instead of typing your password every time you interact with a remote repository, you use a cryptographic key pair: a private key that you keep secret on your local machine and a public key that you upload to the server. When you attempt to connect, your Git client uses the private key to prove your identity, and the server verifies it against the corresponding public key.

This method eliminates the risk of password interception and brute-force attacks. To generate an SSH key pair, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command in your terminal. For example:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This command generates a new Ed25519 key pair, which is a modern and secure algorithm. After generating the key pair, you'll need to add the public key (usually located in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) to your GitHub account settings. You can view the contents of the public key file using `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` and then copy and paste it into the appropriate field on GitHub. Once configured, Git operations like `git push` and `git pull` will be authenticated using your SSH key, streamlining your workflow and enhancing security.
