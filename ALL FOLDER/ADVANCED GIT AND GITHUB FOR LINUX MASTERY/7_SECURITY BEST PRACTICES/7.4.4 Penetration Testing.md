Penetration testing, often shortened to "pen testing," is a crucial component of vulnerability management. It's a simulated cyberattack against your system to identify vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. Unlike vulnerability scanning, which passively identifies potential weaknesses, penetration testing actively attempts to exploit those weaknesses to determine the real-world impact. This proactive approach allows you to understand the severity of vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts effectively.

Penetration tests can take many forms, from black-box testing (where the tester has no prior knowledge of the system) to white-box testing (where the tester has full knowledge). A common example is attempting to exploit a known vulnerability in a web application, such as SQL injection. A pen tester might try to inject malicious SQL code into a form field to gain unauthorized access to the database. Another example could be attempting to bypass authentication mechanisms using techniques like brute-force attacks or exploiting weak password policies. The results of a penetration test provide actionable insights into the security posture of your systems and help you strengthen your defenses.
