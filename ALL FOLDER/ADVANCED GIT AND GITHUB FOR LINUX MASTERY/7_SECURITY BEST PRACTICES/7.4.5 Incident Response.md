Incident Response is a critical component of Vulnerability Management, focusing on the actions taken _after_ a security incident has been detected. While vulnerability scanning and patching aim to prevent breaches, Incident Response outlines the procedures for containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents that do occur, minimizing damage and restoring normal operations as quickly as possible. It's the "firefighting" aspect of security, ensuring a swift and effective reaction to threats that bypass preventative measures.

A well-defined Incident Response plan includes steps for identifying the scope of the incident, isolating affected systems, analyzing the root cause, and implementing corrective actions to prevent recurrence. For example, if a compromised Git repository is detected (perhaps due to leaked credentials), the Incident Response plan would dictate steps like immediately revoking the compromised credentials, auditing the repository for unauthorized changes, and notifying affected developers. Another example might involve a denial-of-service attack targeting a GitHub Pages site; the response would involve identifying the source of the attack, implementing rate limiting or other mitigation techniques, and restoring service availability. Effective Incident Response requires clear communication, documented procedures, and a dedicated team responsible for executing the plan.
