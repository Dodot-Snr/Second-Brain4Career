Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. In the context of Git and GitHub, RBAC allows administrators to define specific roles (e.g., "Developer," "Maintainer," "Read-Only") and assign permissions to those roles. Users are then assigned to one or more roles, inheriting the associated permissions. This simplifies access management and enhances security by ensuring users only have the necessary privileges to perform their tasks.

RBAC is a powerful tool for managing permissions in GitHub organizations and repositories. For example, you might create a "Triage" role with permission to label issues and pull requests, but not to merge code. Another example is a "Security Auditor" role with read-only access to all repositories in the organization, allowing them to review code for vulnerabilities without the ability to make changes. This granular control minimizes the risk of accidental or malicious modifications while streamlining collaboration.
