HTTPS authentication is a method of verifying your identity to GitHub (or other Git hosting providers) when interacting with repositories over HTTPS. It involves providing your username and a personal access token (PAT) or password each time Git needs to access a protected resource. While less secure and convenient than SSH keys, HTTPS authentication is often a good starting point and a fallback option when SSH is not feasible.

When using HTTPS authentication, Git prompts you for your credentials. You can configure Git to store these credentials in a credential manager, so you don't have to enter them every time. This is especially useful when working with multiple repositories or frequently pushing and pulling changes. However, storing credentials requires careful consideration of security best practices.

For example, instead of using your GitHub password directly (which is discouraged), you should generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) with specific scopes (permissions) relevant to your Git operations. To generate a PAT, navigate to your GitHub settings, then Developer settings, then Personal access tokens. When prompted for your password, you can then enter the generated PAT. This PAT can then be used in place of your password when Git prompts you for authentication.
