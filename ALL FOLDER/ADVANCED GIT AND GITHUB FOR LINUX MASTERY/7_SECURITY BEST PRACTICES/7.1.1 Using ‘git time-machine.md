`git time-machine` is a powerful tool for visualizing the history of a file within your Git repository. It allows you to step through each commit that modified a specific file, showing you the changes introduced at each point in time. This is incredibly useful for understanding how a file evolved, debugging when a particular line of code was introduced, or simply exploring the history of a complex piece of software. Unlike `git blame`, which focuses on the last modification of each line, `git time-machine` provides a chronological view of the entire file's evolution.

To use `git time-machine`, you typically invoke it with the filename you want to explore. For example, `git time-machine my_script.py` will open a visual interface (often in your terminal) that allows you to navigate through the commits that modified `my_script.py`. You can then step forward and backward through the commits, viewing the diffs and the full file content at each stage. This makes it easy to pinpoint exactly when a bug was introduced or when a specific feature was added.

Another useful example is using `git time-machine` with a specific branch. If you want to see the history of a file on a particular branch, you can specify the branch name like this: `git time-machine --branch feature/new-feature my_script.py`. This will limit the history to only commits that are reachable from the `feature/new-feature` branch, providing a more focused view of the file's evolution within that specific context.
