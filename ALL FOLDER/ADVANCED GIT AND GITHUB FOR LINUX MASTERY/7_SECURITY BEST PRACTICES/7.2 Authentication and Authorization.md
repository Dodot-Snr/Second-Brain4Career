Authentication and authorization are critical security components for managing Git repositories, especially in collaborative environments. Authentication verifies _who_ you are, confirming your identity to the Git server (like GitHub). Authorization, on the other hand, determines _what_ you are allowed to do, controlling your access level to specific repositories and branches. Without proper authentication and authorization, unauthorized users could potentially access, modify, or even delete sensitive code.

Common authentication methods include username/password combinations (though increasingly discouraged), SSH keys, and personal access tokens (PATs). SSH keys provide a more secure and convenient way to authenticate, eliminating the need to repeatedly enter passwords. PATs are useful for automating tasks or granting access to specific resources without exposing your primary account credentials. For example, you might use a PAT to allow a CI/CD pipeline to push changes to a repository on your behalf.

Authorization is typically managed through roles and permissions. GitHub offers different roles (e.g., owner, administrator, write, read) that define the level of access a user has to a repository. Branch protection rules further enhance authorization by restricting who can push directly to protected branches like `main` or `develop`, often requiring code reviews and passing status checks before merging. For example, you can configure a branch protection rule that requires two reviewers to approve a pull request before it can be merged into the `main` branch, ensuring higher code quality and preventing accidental deployments.
