Encryption at rest refers to the practice of encrypting data when it is stored on a persistent storage medium, such as a hard drive, SSD, or cloud storage. This ensures that even if the storage device is physically compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals, the data remains unreadable without the correct decryption key. It's a crucial component of data protection, especially when dealing with sensitive information within Git repositories or GitHub environments.

In the context of Git and GitHub, encryption at rest can be applied to various aspects of your workflow. For example, you might encrypt your local Git repository using tools like `git-remote-gcrypt` to protect sensitive code or configuration files stored within it. Another example is encrypting the entire file system where your Git repositories reside using tools like LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup). This provides a comprehensive layer of security, ensuring that even if someone gains access to the underlying storage, they cannot easily access your Git data.
