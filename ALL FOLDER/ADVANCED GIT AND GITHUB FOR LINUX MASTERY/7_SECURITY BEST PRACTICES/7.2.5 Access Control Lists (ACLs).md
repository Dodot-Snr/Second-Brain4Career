Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide a more granular approach to file permissions than the traditional owner/group/other model. While standard permissions offer broad control, ACLs allow you to define specific permissions for individual users or groups on a file or directory, regardless of their ownership or group membership. This is crucial for collaborative environments where multiple users need varying levels of access to shared resources.

ACLs enhance security and flexibility. For example, you might grant a specific user read and write access to a file owned by another user, without affecting the permissions of other users. This is achieved by adding entries to the ACL that specify the user or group and the permissions they are granted (read, write, execute). The `getfacl` command is used to view ACLs, and `setfacl` is used to modify them.

Consider a scenario where a project team needs access to a shared directory. Instead of making everyone a member of the same group (which might grant broader access than intended), you can use ACLs to grant specific users read and write access to the directory and its contents. For instance, `setfacl -m u:alice:rwx directory_name` would grant user "alice" read, write, and execute permissions on "directory_name". This targeted approach minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and simplifies permission management.
