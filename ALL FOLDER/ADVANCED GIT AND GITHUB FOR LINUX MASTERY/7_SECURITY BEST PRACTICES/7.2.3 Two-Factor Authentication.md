Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your Git and GitHub accounts beyond just a username and password. It requires you to provide a second verification factor, typically something you _have_ (like a phone or security key) in addition to something you _know_ (your password). This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.

Common 2FA methods include Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) generated by authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator. When logging in, you'll enter your password as usual, and then the app will provide a unique, short-lived code that you must also enter. Another method involves using hardware security keys like YubiKey, which require physical presence and interaction to authenticate. GitHub strongly encourages enabling 2FA for all users, especially those contributing to open-source projects or managing sensitive repositories.

For example, if someone steals your password, they still won't be able to access your GitHub account without also having access to your phone and the authenticator app generating the TOTP. Similarly, if you use a YubiKey, the attacker would need physical possession of your key to bypass the 2FA protection.
