Git aliases are custom shortcuts for Git commands. They allow you to create shorter, more memorable commands for frequently used Git operations, saving you time and reducing the chance of typos. Aliases are defined in your Git configuration file (`.gitconfig` in your home directory) and can significantly improve your workflow efficiency. Think of them as personalized abbreviations for complex Git commands.

By creating aliases, you can simplify complex commands into single words or short phrases. For example, instead of typing `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`, you could create an alias like `git new-branch feature/new-feature`. This not only saves keystrokes but also makes your commands easier to remember and understand. Aliases can also incorporate shell commands, allowing for even more powerful and customized Git workflows.

Here are a couple of examples:

- To create an alias `git st` for `git status`, you would use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global alias.st status
    ```
    
- To create an alias `git lg` for a more visually appealing log output, you might use:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
    ```
