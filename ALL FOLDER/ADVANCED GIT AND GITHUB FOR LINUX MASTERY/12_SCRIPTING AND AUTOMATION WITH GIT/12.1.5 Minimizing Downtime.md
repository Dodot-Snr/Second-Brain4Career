Downtime is the enemy of any production system. In the context of Git and GitHub, minimizing downtime during disaster recovery involves strategies to quickly restore your codebase and deployment pipelines after an incident. This often means having robust backup and recovery plans, but also leveraging Git features to facilitate rapid rollbacks and hotfixes. The goal is to reduce the impact on users and maintain business continuity.

Several Git-centric techniques can help minimize downtime. For example, using feature flags allows you to disable problematic features without a full deployment rollback. If a new feature introduced a bug, you can simply toggle the flag off in your configuration, instantly reverting the change for users. Another example is using Git's `revert` command to quickly undo a faulty commit. This creates a new commit that reverses the changes introduced by the problematic commit, allowing you to deploy a fix without rewriting history.

Consider a scenario where a recent deployment introduced a critical bug that crashes the application. Instead of scrambling to identify and fix the bug directly in the production environment, you can use `git revert <faulty_commit_hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes. This new commit can then be pushed to production, effectively rolling back the problematic changes and restoring the application to a stable state while you investigate the root cause.

```bash
git revert <faulty_commit_hash>
git push origin main
```
