Webhooks are automated HTTP callbacks triggered by specific events within a Git repository, enabling real-time integration with other services and applications. Instead of constantly polling the Git API for changes, your application can "subscribe" to events like pushes, pull requests, or issue creation. When these events occur, GitHub (or your Git server) sends an HTTP POST request to a pre-configured URL, delivering a payload containing information about the event. This allows for immediate and reactive responses, automating workflows and streamlining development processes.

Event handling involves processing the data received in the webhook payload. Your application needs to parse the JSON payload, identify the event type, and then execute the appropriate actions. For example, a webhook triggered by a `push` event could automatically trigger a build and deployment pipeline. Another example is using a webhook triggered by a `pull_request` event to automatically run code linters and static analysis tools, posting the results as comments on the pull request. This immediate feedback loop helps maintain code quality and accelerates the review process.

```json
// Example payload for a 'push' event
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "before": "d34db33f",
  "after": "a11ceba2",
  "repository": {
    "name": "my-repo",
    "full_name": "my-org/my-repo"
  },
  "pusher": {
    "name": "octocat",
    "email": "octocat@github.com"
  }
}
```
