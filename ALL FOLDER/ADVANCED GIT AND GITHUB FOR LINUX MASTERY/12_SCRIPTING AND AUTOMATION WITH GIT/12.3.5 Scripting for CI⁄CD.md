This section delves into using shell scripting to automate Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. CI/CD pipelines are automated workflows that build, test, and deploy code changes. Shell scripts are invaluable for orchestrating these pipelines, allowing you to define the steps involved in each stage, from pulling code from a Git repository to deploying it to a production environment. By automating these processes, you can significantly reduce errors, improve efficiency, and accelerate the software development lifecycle.

A common use case is automating testing. For example, a script might pull the latest code from a Git branch, install dependencies, run unit tests, and report the results. If the tests pass, the script might then proceed to build a deployable artifact. Another example is automating deployments. A script could connect to a remote server, stop the existing application, deploy the new artifact, and restart the application.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: Simple test script
echo "Running unit tests..."
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "*_test.py"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests passed!"
else
  echo "Tests failed!"
  exit 1
fi
```

This simple script demonstrates how to run Python unit tests and check the exit code to determine if the tests passed or failed. This is a fundamental building block for more complex CI/CD scripts.
