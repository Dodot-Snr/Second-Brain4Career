When writing shell scripts that interact with Git, it's crucial to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. A script that crashes unexpectedly can leave your Git repository in an inconsistent state or disrupt automated workflows. Effective error handling involves anticipating potential problems, checking the exit status of commands, and implementing appropriate responses, such as logging errors, displaying informative messages, or attempting recovery actions.

One common technique is to use the `set -e` command at the beginning of your script. This instructs the shell to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status (indicating an error). You can then use `if` statements to check the exit status of specific Git commands and take action accordingly. For example:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Error: Git commit failed!" >&2 # Redirect to stderr
  exit 1
fi
```

Another useful approach is to use `try...catch` blocks (emulated in bash using `||`) to handle exceptions. This allows you to execute a block of code and, if an error occurs, execute a different block of code to handle the error. This is particularly useful for cleaning up temporary files or reverting changes if a Git command fails midway through a complex operation.
