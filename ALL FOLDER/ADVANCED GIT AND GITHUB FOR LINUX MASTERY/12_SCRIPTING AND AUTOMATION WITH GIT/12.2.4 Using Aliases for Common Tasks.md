Git aliases are custom shortcuts for Git commands, allowing you to streamline your workflow and avoid typing long or frequently used commands repeatedly. They are defined in your Git configuration file (`.gitconfig` in your home directory) and can significantly improve your efficiency when working with Git. By creating aliases, you can map complex commands or sequences of commands to shorter, more memorable names.

Aliases can be simple, like shortening `git status` to `git st`, or more complex, incorporating multiple commands or even shell scripts. This allows you to create custom workflows tailored to your specific needs. For example, you might create an alias to view the commit history in a specific format or to quickly undo the last commit.

Here are a couple of examples:

- To create an alias `git last` that shows the last commit:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'
    ```
    
    Now, running `git last` will display the most recent commit.
    
- To create an alias `git undo` that undoes the last commit:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global alias.undo 'reset HEAD~1 --mixed'
    ```
    
    Running `git undo` will unstage the last commit and move the changes to your working directory.
