Beyond simple aliases, Git allows you to create custom commands by leveraging shell scripts or other executable programs. This empowers you to automate complex workflows, integrate external tools, and tailor Git to your specific needs. By placing executable scripts in your `$PATH` and naming them `git-something`, Git will recognize `git something` as a valid command.

These custom commands can perform a wide range of tasks, from automating repetitive tasks to integrating with external services. For example, you could create a `git-standup` command that automatically pulls the latest changes, lists recent commits, and displays your current branch. Another example could be a `git-publish` command that builds your project, runs tests, and deploys it to a staging server.

Here's a simple example of a `git-count-lines` command (saved as `git-count-lines` in a directory in your `$PATH`) that counts the lines of code in your Git repository:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
git ls-files | xargs wc -l | tail -n 1
```

After making the script executable (`chmod +x git-count-lines`), you can run it with `git count-lines`. This level of customization allows you to significantly enhance your Git workflow and productivity.
