Blobs (Binary Large Objects) are one of the core object types in Git's content-addressable file system. Essentially, a blob represents the content of a file. Unlike commits or trees, blobs don't contain any metadata about the file, such as its name or modification time. They simply store the raw data. Git uses blobs to efficiently store and manage different versions of your files. If a file's content changes, Git creates a new blob to represent the updated version, while the old blob remains untouched. This immutability is crucial for Git's version control capabilities.

Think of a blob as a snapshot of a file's content at a specific point in time. For example, if you have a text file named `my_document.txt` containing the text "Hello, world!", Git will create a blob object to store that exact string. If you later edit the file to say "Hello, Git!", Git will create a _new_ blob object containing the updated text. The original blob still exists, allowing you to revert to the previous version of the file. You can view the contents of a blob using the `git cat-file -p <blob_hash>` command, where `<blob_hash>` is the SHA-1 hash of the blob object. For example:

```bash
git cat-file -p e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391
```

This command would display the content of the blob with the hash `e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391` to your terminal.
