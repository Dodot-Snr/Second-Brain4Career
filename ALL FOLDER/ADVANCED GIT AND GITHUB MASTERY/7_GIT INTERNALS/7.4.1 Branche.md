Branches are a fundamental concept in Git, acting as lightweight, movable pointers to a specific commit. They allow you to diverge from the main line of development (typically `main` or `master`) and work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation. This isolation prevents unstable code from affecting the primary codebase and enables parallel development by multiple contributors. Think of them as parallel universes of your project, where you can freely experiment without impacting the original timeline.

When you create a new branch, Git essentially creates a new pointer that points to the same commit as the branch you branched from. As you make new commits on the new branch, the branch pointer moves forward, while the original branch remains unchanged. This allows you to merge the changes from the new branch back into the original branch later, if desired. For example, you might create a branch called `feature/new-login` to develop a new login system. All your commits related to the login system will be on this branch, separate from the `main` branch.

A common workflow involves creating a branch for each new feature or bug fix. For instance, if you're fixing a bug reported in production, you might create a branch named `bugfix/issue-123`. After verifying the fix on this branch, you can merge it back into the `main` branch and deploy the updated code. The following command demonstrates creating a new branch:

```bash
git branch feature/new-feature
```
