Remote tracking branches are local references to the state of remote branches. They act as bookmarks, recording the last known location of branches on your remote repositories (like `origin`). These branches are crucial for understanding how your local repository relates to the remote repository and for coordinating collaboration. You don't directly commit to remote tracking branches; instead, Git automatically updates them when you fetch data from the remote. This allows you to compare your local work with the remote's state without directly interacting with the remote branches themselves.

Think of `origin/main` as a snapshot of the `main` branch on the `origin` remote the last time you fetched. When you run `git fetch origin`, Git updates `origin/main` to reflect the current state of the `main` branch on the `origin` remote. You can then use this information to create local branches based on the remote state or to compare your local branch with the remote branch. For example, if you want to create a local branch based on the remote's `develop` branch, you would use `git checkout -b my-feature origin/develop`.

A common scenario is checking the difference between your local `main` branch and the remote `origin/main` branch. You can do this using the command `git diff main origin/main`. This will show you all the changes that exist in your local `main` branch that are not yet present in the remote `origin/main` branch, giving you a clear picture of what you need to push. Understanding and utilizing remote tracking branches is essential for effective collaboration and managing your Git workflow.
