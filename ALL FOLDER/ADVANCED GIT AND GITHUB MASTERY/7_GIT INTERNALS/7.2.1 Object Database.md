The object database is the heart of Git's storage mechanism, residing within the `.git/objects` directory. It's where Git stores all the data for your repository, including files, directories (represented as trees), commits, and tags. These objects are stored as content-addressable blobs, meaning they are named based on the SHA-1 hash of their content. This ensures data integrity and efficient storage, as identical files are only stored once.

Git uses a key-value store approach. The SHA-1 hash acts as the key, and the compressed object data is the value. When you add a file to the staging area (using `git add`), Git calculates the SHA-1 hash of the file's content, compresses the content, and stores it as a blob object in the object database. Similarly, when you commit, Git creates a tree object representing the directory structure and a commit object pointing to the tree and parent commits.

For example, if you have a file named `my_file.txt` with the content "Hello, world!", Git will calculate its SHA-1 hash (let's say it's `e9cb7ea112794171f7114199951e429a78b19999`). The compressed content "Hello, world!" will then be stored in `.git/objects/e9/cb7ea112794171f7114199951e429a78b19999`. You can view the object type and content using `git cat-file -t <object_hash>` and `git cat-file -p <object_hash>` respectively.

```bash
git cat-file -t e9cb7ea112794171f7114199951e429a78b19999
# Output: blob

git cat-file -p e9cb7ea112794171f7114199951e429a78b19999
# Output: Hello, world!
```
