Conflicts are an inevitable part of collaborative Git workflows, arising when multiple developers modify the same lines in a file simultaneously. Understanding how to identify, analyze, and resolve these conflicts is crucial for maintaining a clean and functional codebase. Git provides tools to help you navigate these situations, marking conflicting sections within the affected files and allowing you to choose which changes to keep, merge, or edit.

When a conflict occurs, Git inserts special markers into the file, delineating the conflicting sections. These markers typically look like `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch_name`. Your task is to manually edit the file, removing these markers and deciding which changes to incorporate. For example, imagine two developers edited the `README.md` file. One added a new feature description, and the other updated the installation instructions in the same section. Git will flag this as a conflict, requiring manual resolution.

After resolving the conflicts, you stage the modified file using `git add <filename>` and then commit the changes with `git commit`. This creates a new commit that incorporates the resolved changes, allowing you to continue with your workflow. Mastering conflict resolution ensures smooth collaboration and prevents data loss in your Git repositories.
