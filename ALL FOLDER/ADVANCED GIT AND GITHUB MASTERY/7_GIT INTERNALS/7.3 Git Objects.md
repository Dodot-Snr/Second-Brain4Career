Git's core functionality revolves around a content-addressable filesystem. This means everything in Git – files, directories, commit history – is stored as an _object_, uniquely identified by its SHA-1 hash. Understanding these objects is crucial for advanced Git usage, allowing you to manipulate Git's internals and troubleshoot complex issues. There are four primary types of Git objects: blobs, trees, commits, and tags.

Blobs represent the content of files. Trees represent directories, containing pointers to blobs (files) and other trees (subdirectories). Commits represent snapshots of the repository at a specific point in time, pointing to a single top-level tree and containing metadata like author, committer, and commit message. Tags are references to specific commits, providing a human-readable alias.

For example, imagine you have a file named `my_file.txt` with the content "Hello, world!". Git would store this content as a blob object. If you then add this file to your repository and commit it, Git would create a tree object representing the directory containing `my_file.txt`, and a commit object pointing to that tree. You can view the SHA-1 hash of a blob using `git hash-object -w my_file.txt` which will store the object in the `.git/objects` directory. Understanding how these objects are linked together is key to understanding Git's data model.
