Trees in Git are essentially directory snapshots. They don't store file data directly; instead, they hold blobs (which contain the file data) and other trees (subdirectories). Think of a tree as a file system directory, but instead of files, it contains pointers to blobs (files) and other trees (subdirectories). This hierarchical structure allows Git to represent the entire directory structure of your project at a specific point in time. Each tree object has a unique SHA-1 hash, just like blobs, making it immutable and identifiable.

A tree object contains a list of entries, each representing a file or subdirectory. Each entry includes the mode (file type and permissions), the type (blob or tree), the object's SHA-1 hash, and the name of the file or directory. For example, a tree representing the root directory of a project might contain entries for `README.md` (a blob) and a subdirectory named `src` (another tree). This nested structure allows Git to efficiently track changes to the entire project over time.

For example, if you have a project with a directory structure like this:

```
project/
├── README.md
└── src/
    └��─ main.py
```

Git would create a tree object for the `src` directory, containing an entry for `main.py` (pointing to its blob). Then, it would create another tree object for the root directory (`project/`), containing entries for `README.md` (pointing to its blob) and the `src` tree object. This structure allows Git to quickly compare different versions of the project by comparing the tree objects and their contents.
