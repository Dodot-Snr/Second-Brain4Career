Tags in Git are essentially pointers to specific points in your repository's history. Unlike branches, which are mutable and evolve as you add commits, tags are typically used to mark release points or significant milestones in your project. Think of them as permanent bookmarks that allow you to easily refer back to a particular version of your code. They are crucial for versioning and provide a clear and understandable way to identify releases (e.g., v1.0, v2.0-beta).

There are two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated. Lightweight tags are simply pointers to a commit and don't store any extra information. Annotated tags, on the other hand, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They contain the tagger name, email, date, and a tagging message. Annotated tags are generally recommended because they provide more metadata and are more robust.

For example, to create an annotated tag named "v1.0", you would use the command `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"`. To create a lightweight tag, you would simply use `git tag v1.0-lightweight`. You can then list all your tags using `git tag` and inspect a specific tag using `git show v1.0`. These tags allow you to easily checkout the state of your repository at that specific point in time using `git checkout v1.0`.
