Commits are the cornerstone of Git's version control system. They are essentially snapshots of your entire project at a specific point in time. Each commit contains metadata like the author, committer, date, and a descriptive message explaining the changes made. Crucially, a commit also points to the tree object representing the directory structure and content of the project at that moment, as well as the parent commit(s), forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the project's history. This lineage allows Git to efficiently track changes and revert to previous states.

Think of a commit as a permanent record of your work. When you make changes to your files and stage them, running `git commit -m "Your descriptive message"` creates a new commit object. This object doesn't just store the changes themselves (the diff), but the entire state of the project. This is why Git can quickly switch between different versions of your project without needing to store multiple full copies.

For example, imagine you've added a new feature to your website. You've modified the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. After staging these changes, you commit them with the message "feat: Implement user authentication". This commit now represents the state of your project with the user authentication feature implemented. If you later decide to remove this feature, you can easily revert to the commit _before_ this one, effectively undoing all the changes introduced by the "feat: Implement user authentication" commit.
