Tags in Git are essentially pointers to specific points in your repository's history, typically used to mark release versions (v1.0, v2.0-beta, etc.). Unlike branches, tags are generally considered immutable, meaning they are not intended to be moved after creation. This makes them ideal for creating permanent snapshots of your project at significant milestones. They provide a human-readable and easily identifiable reference to a particular commit.

There are two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated. Lightweight tags are simply pointers to a commit and don't store any additional information. Annotated tags, on the other hand, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They contain the tagger name, email, date, and a tagging message. Annotated tags are generally recommended because they provide more metadata and are more robust.

For example, to create an annotated tag:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
```

And to create a lightweight tag:

```bash
git tag v1.1
```

You can then push these tags to a remote repository using `git push origin --tags`.
