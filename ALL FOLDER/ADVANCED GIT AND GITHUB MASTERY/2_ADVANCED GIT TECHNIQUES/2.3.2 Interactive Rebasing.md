Interactive rebasing takes the power of rebasing a step further, allowing you to not only move commits but also to edit, combine, or even remove them. This is particularly useful for cleaning up your commit history before merging a feature branch into the main branch, ensuring a clear and concise record of changes. Unlike standard rebasing, interactive rebasing opens an editor where you can specify exactly what you want to do with each commit in the range you're rebasing.

To initiate an interactive rebase, you use the command `git rebase -i <commit>`, where `<commit>` is the commit before the first commit you want to modify. The editor will then display a list of commits with instructions on the actions you can take, such as `pick`, `reword`, `edit`, `squash`, `fixup`, `exec`, `drop`, and `label/reset/merge/push/reapply`. For example, you might use `reword` to change a commit message, `squash` to combine multiple commits into one, or `drop` to remove a commit entirely.

A common use case is to combine several small, related commits into a single, more meaningful commit. Imagine you have three commits: "Fix typo," "Add missing semicolon," and "Implement feature X." You could use interactive rebasing to squash the first two commits into the third, resulting in a cleaner history with just "Implement feature X." Another example is editing a commit to add a forgotten change. You would use `edit` on the relevant commit, make your changes, stage them, and then run `git commit --amend` followed by `git rebase --continue`. Interactive rebasing provides fine-grained control over your commit history, enabling you to create a polished and understandable record of your work.
