Stashing is a powerful Git feature that allows you to temporarily shelve changes you've made in your working directory so you can work on something else, and then come back and reapply them later. This is particularly useful when you're in the middle of a feature implementation, but need to quickly switch to a different branch to fix a bug or address an urgent issue. Instead of committing half-finished work, you can stash it away, ensuring a clean working directory.

Think of stashing as a temporary save point. You can stash untracked, modified, and staged files. When you're ready to resume your work, you can pop the stash, reapplying the changes to your working directory. Git keeps a stack of stashes, so you can have multiple stashes saved at once.

For example, if you're working on a feature branch and need to address a hotfix on the `main` branch, you can use `git stash` to save your current changes. After switching to `main`, applying the hotfix, and committing, you can switch back to your feature branch and use `git stash pop` to reapply your stashed changes and continue working on your feature. Another common use case is when you want to pull the latest changes from the remote repository but have local modifications. Stashing allows you to pull without conflicts, then reapply your changes afterward.
