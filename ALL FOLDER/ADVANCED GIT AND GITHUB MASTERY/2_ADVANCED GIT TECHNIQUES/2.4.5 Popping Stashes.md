Popping a stash is the process of removing a stash from the stash list and applying its changes to your working directory. Unlike applying a stash, which leaves the stash in the stash list, popping removes it. This is useful when you're confident you no longer need the stashed changes after applying them. The command `git stash pop` applies the most recently created stash (stash@{0}) by default and then immediately drops it from the stash list.

For example, if you have a stash containing changes to a file named `my_file.txt`, running `git stash pop` will attempt to merge those changes into your current working directory. If the merge is successful, the stash will be removed. If conflicts arise during the merge, Git will leave conflict markers in `my_file.txt` for you to resolve, but the stash will still be removed. You can also specify a particular stash to pop using its index, such as `git stash pop stash@{2}` to pop the third stash in the list.

It's important to note that popping a stash is a destructive operation. Once a stash is popped and removed, it's gone unless you've taken other measures to preserve it (e.g., creating a branch from it before popping). Therefore, it's generally a good practice to apply a stash first to ensure the changes merge cleanly before popping it, especially if the stash contains significant or complex changes.
