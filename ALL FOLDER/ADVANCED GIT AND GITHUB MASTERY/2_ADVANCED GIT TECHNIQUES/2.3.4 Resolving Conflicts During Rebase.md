Rebasing, while powerful, isn't always smooth sailing. When your branch has diverged significantly from the target branch, or when multiple developers have modified the same lines of code, conflicts can arise during the rebase process. These conflicts occur because Git can't automatically determine which changes to keep. Resolving these conflicts is a crucial skill for maintaining a clean and consistent project history.

When a conflict occurs, Git will pause the rebase and mark the conflicting files. You'll need to manually edit these files to resolve the discrepancies. Git inserts conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) to highlight the conflicting sections. Your task is to examine these sections, decide which changes to keep (or combine them), remove the conflict markers, and then stage the resolved file. After resolving all conflicts in a file, you use `git add <file>` to stage the changes and then `git rebase --continue` to proceed with the rebase.

For example, imagine two developers, Alice and Bob, are working on the same file, `README.md`. Alice modifies the introduction, while Bob updates the installation instructions. When Bob tries to rebase his branch onto Alice's, a conflict might occur if their changes overlap. Bob would then need to open `README.md`, examine the conflict markers, decide how to merge the introduction and installation instructions, remove the markers, stage the file, and continue the rebase. Another common scenario is when you've refactored code in your feature branch that has also been changed in the main branch. Resolving these conflicts often involves understanding the intent behind both sets of changes and carefully merging them to maintain functionality.
