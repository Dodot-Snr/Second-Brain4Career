Once you've stashed your changes, you'll eventually want to retrieve them and continue working. This is where applying stashes comes in. Applying a stash takes the changes stored in a stash and attempts to merge them into your current working directory. Git provides several ways to apply stashes, offering flexibility in how you integrate the stashed changes. The most common command is `git stash apply`, which applies the most recently created stash (stash@{0}) by default. You can also specify a particular stash to apply using its index, such as `git stash apply stash@{2}`.

Applying a stash doesn't remove it from the stash list. This is useful if you want to apply the same changes to multiple branches or need to re-apply them later. However, if you're sure you no longer need the stash after applying it, you can use `git stash pop` instead. `git stash pop` applies the stash and then immediately removes it from the stash list. This is equivalent to running `git stash apply` followed by `git stash drop`.

For example, if you have a stash with changes to both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, running `git stash apply` will attempt to merge those changes into your current working directory. If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually before committing. Alternatively, if you want to apply the changes from the second stash in your stash list and then remove it, you would use the command `git stash pop stash@{1}`.
