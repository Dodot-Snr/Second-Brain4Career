Once you've created one or more stashes, you'll likely need to view them to recall what changes you've saved and decide which one to apply. Git provides a straightforward command to list your stashes: `git stash list`. This command displays a list of your stashes, each identified by a stash index (e.g., `stash@{0}`, `stash@{1}`) and a brief description. The description usually includes the branch the stash was created from and the commit message of the HEAD at the time of stashing.

The output of `git stash list` helps you identify the stash you want to work with. For example, if you see `stash@{0}: WIP on main: 5d2a9b3 Fixed a bug`, you know that `stash@{0}` contains work in progress on the `main` branch related to fixing a bug. This information is crucial when you have multiple stashes and need to choose the correct one to apply or inspect.

```bash
git stash list
# Output:
# stash@{0}: WIP on main: 5d2a9b3 Fixed a bug
# stash@{1}: WIP on feature/new-feature: a1b2c3d Added initial implementation
```
