Rebasing and merging are the two primary methods for integrating changes from one branch into another in Git. While both achieve the same fundamental goal – incorporating new code – they differ significantly in how they rewrite history and impact the commit graph. Understanding these differences is crucial for maintaining a clean and understandable project history. Rebasing essentially replays your commits on top of the target branch, creating a linear history. Merging, on the other hand, creates a new "merge commit" that explicitly joins the two branches, preserving the history of both.

The choice between rebasing and merging often depends on the specific context and team preferences. Rebasing is generally favored for keeping the main branch history clean and easy to follow, especially for feature branches. For example, before merging a feature branch into `main`, you might rebase your feature branch onto the latest `main` to ensure a fast-forward merge and a linear history. However, rebasing public branches that others are working on is generally discouraged, as it can cause confusion and conflicts for collaborators. Merging is often preferred for long-lived branches or when preserving the complete history of all branches is paramount.

Consider a scenario where you have a `feature/new-ui` branch diverging from `main`. If `main` has advanced since you branched, rebasing `feature/new-ui` onto `main` would rewrite the `feature/new-ui` commits as if they were based on the latest `main`. Alternatively, merging `main` into `feature/new-ui` would create a merge commit on `feature/new-ui`, explicitly showing the integration point. The `git log` output will look different depending on which strategy you choose.
