Rebasing is a powerful Git technique used to integrate changes from one branch into another. Unlike merging, which creates a new merge commit, rebasing rewrites the commit history of the target branch to appear as if it branched off from the latest commit of the base branch. This results in a cleaner, linear history, making it easier to understand the project's evolution. However, it's crucial to understand the implications of rewriting history, especially when working collaboratively.

The primary use case for rebasing is to keep feature branches up-to-date with the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`). For example, if you've been working on a feature branch for a week while `main` has received several updates, rebasing your feature branch onto `main` will incorporate those changes into your branch's history. This helps avoid complex merge conflicts later on and ensures your feature is built on the latest codebase. Another common scenario is cleaning up local commits before pushing to a remote repository. You might rebase to squash multiple small commits into a single, more meaningful commit.

Here's a basic example: Suppose you're on your `feature-branch` and want to rebase it onto `main`. You would first checkout `feature-branch` and then run `git rebase main`. Git will then apply your `feature-branch` commits on top of the current `main` branch. If conflicts arise during the rebase, you'll need to resolve them before continuing with `git rebase --continue`. Once the rebase is complete, your `feature-branch` will appear as if it branched off from the latest commit on `main`.
