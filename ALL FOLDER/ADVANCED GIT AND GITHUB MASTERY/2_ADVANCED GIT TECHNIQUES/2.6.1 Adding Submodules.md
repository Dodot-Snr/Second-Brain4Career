Submodules allow you to include a separate Git repository as a subdirectory within your main repository. This is useful when you have dependencies or shared libraries that are maintained in their own repositories. Instead of copying the code directly, you can link to the external repository, ensuring you always have a specific version of that code and can easily update it.

To add a submodule, you use the `git submodule add` command followed by the repository URL and the desired path within your project. For example, if you have a library called "my-library" hosted on GitHub and want to include it in your "my-project" repository under the "libs/my-library" directory, you would run:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/example/my-library.git libs/my-library
```

This command clones the "my-library" repository into the specified directory and adds an entry to the `.gitmodules` file, which tracks the submodules in your project. After adding a submodule, you need to commit the changes to both the `.gitmodules` file and the newly created submodule directory to your main repository. This ensures that others cloning your repository will know about the submodule and its location.
