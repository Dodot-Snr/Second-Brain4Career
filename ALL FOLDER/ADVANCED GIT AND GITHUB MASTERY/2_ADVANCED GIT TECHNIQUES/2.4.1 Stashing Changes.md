Stashing is a powerful Git feature that allows you to temporarily shelve changes you've made in your working directory so you can work on something else, and then come back and reapply them later. This is particularly useful when you need to switch branches quickly to address a bug or work on a higher-priority task without committing half-finished work. Think of it as a temporary save point for your uncommitted changes.

The primary use case for stashing is to clean your working directory when you need to switch branches. For example, you might be working on a new feature, but then a critical bug is reported on the `main` branch. Instead of committing your unfinished feature, you can stash your changes, switch to `main`, fix the bug, and then return to your feature branch and unstash your work. Another example is when you want to pull the latest changes from a remote repository, but you have local modifications that would cause a merge conflict. Stashing allows you to pull the changes and then reapply your local modifications.

Here are a couple of key examples:

- `git stash`: This command stashes your uncommitted changes, both staged and unstaged.
- `git stash pop`: This command unstashes the most recently stashed changes and removes them from the stash list.
