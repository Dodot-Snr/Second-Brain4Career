Subtrees offer an alternative to submodules for including external projects within your Git repository. Unlike submodules, which record a specific commit from the external repository, subtrees merge the entire history of the external project into your repository. This means the external project's files become part of your repository's history, making it easier to work with and modify the included code directly. Subtrees are particularly useful when you want to make significant changes to the included project or when you need to avoid the complexities associated with submodules.

The primary advantage of subtrees is their simplicity in terms of workflow. You don't need to initialize or update submodules separately. All the code is directly within your repository. For example, you can add a subtree using the `git subtree add` command, specifying the prefix (directory where the external project will reside), the source repository, and the branch. Subsequent updates from the external project can be pulled in using `git subtree pull`.

Consider a scenario where you have a "docs" repository that you want to include in your main project under the "documentation" directory. You would use `git subtree add --prefix=documentation docs master --squash` to merge the `docs` repository's `master` branch into your project, placing all files under the `documentation` directory. The `--squash` option merges the changes as a single commit, simplifying the history. Similarly, to update the subtree, you would use `git subtree pull --prefix=documentation docs master --squash`.
