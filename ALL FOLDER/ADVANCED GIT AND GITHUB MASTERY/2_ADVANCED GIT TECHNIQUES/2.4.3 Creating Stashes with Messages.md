While stashing is a powerful tool for temporarily shelving changes, simply using `git stash` can lead to confusion later on. When you have multiple stashes, it becomes difficult to remember what each stash contains. This is where stash messages come in handy. By adding a descriptive message to your stash, you can easily identify its purpose and content when you need to retrieve it.

To create a stash with a message, use the `git stash push -m "Your descriptive message here"` command. This command creates a new stash and associates the provided message with it. For example, `git stash push -m "WIP: Refactoring user authentication"` creates a stash with the message "WIP: Refactoring user authentication". You can then view your stashes and their messages using `git stash list`. The output will show the stash index along with the message, making it much easier to find the stash you're looking for.

Using messages with your stashes is a best practice that significantly improves the maintainability and understandability of your Git workflow. Instead of relying on cryptic stash names like "stash@{0}", you can quickly identify the purpose of each stash and avoid accidentally applying the wrong changes. For instance, if you have a stash for experimental feature A and another for bug fix B, clear messages like "Experimental feature A implementation" and "Bug fix for issue #123" will save you time and prevent potential errors.
