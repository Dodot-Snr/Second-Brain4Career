Rebasing is a powerful Git feature that allows you to rewrite the commit history of a branch. Unlike merging, which creates a new merge commit to integrate changes, rebasing moves a branch's commits onto another branch, effectively making it appear as if the branch was branched off from the target branch more recently. This results in a cleaner, linear history, which can be easier to understand and maintain. However, it's crucial to understand the implications of rewriting history, especially when working collaboratively.

The primary use case for rebasing is to integrate changes from a main branch (like `main` or `develop`) into a feature branch. For example, if you've been working on a feature branch for a week, and `main` has had several updates, you can rebase your feature branch onto `main`. This will replay your feature branch commits on top of the latest `main` commits. Another common scenario is cleaning up your local feature branch before merging it into the main branch. You can use interactive rebasing to squash multiple small commits into a single, more meaningful commit.

For example, to rebase your `feature-branch` onto `main`, you would first checkout your feature branch:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```

Then, you would run the rebase command:

```bash
git rebase main
```

If conflicts arise during the rebase, you'll need to resolve them, stage the changes, and then continue the rebase using `git rebase --continue`. Once the rebase is complete, your `feature-branch` will be based on the latest `main` commits. Remember to avoid rebasing public branches that others are working on, as it can cause significant confusion and conflicts.
