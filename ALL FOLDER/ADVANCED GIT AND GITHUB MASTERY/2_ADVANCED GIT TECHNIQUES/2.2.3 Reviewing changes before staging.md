Before adding changes to the staging area using interactive staging, it's crucial to carefully review them. This ensures you're only staging the intended modifications and avoids accidentally committing unwanted code or sensitive information. Git provides several tools to facilitate this review process, allowing for granular control over what gets included in your next commit.

One common method is using `git diff`. Running `git diff` without any arguments shows the changes between your working directory and the staging area. To see the changes you're about to stage interactively, you can use `git diff --patch <file>` after selecting a chunk in interactive staging. This displays a detailed, color-coded view of the modifications within that specific file, allowing you to confirm that the changes are correct and ready to be staged.

For example, if you've modified a file named `my_script.py` and are using `git add -i`, after selecting a chunk to stage, you can run `git diff --patch my_script.py` to see exactly what that chunk contains. This is especially useful when dealing with large files or complex changes, as it helps prevent accidental inclusion of debugging code, commented-out sections, or other unintended modifications.
