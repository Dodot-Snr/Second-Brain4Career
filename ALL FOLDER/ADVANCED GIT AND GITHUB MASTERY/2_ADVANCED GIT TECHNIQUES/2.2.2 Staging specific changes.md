Interactive staging allows for granular control over what changes are included in your commits. Instead of staging entire files with `git add <file>`, you can stage specific hunks or even individual lines within a file. This is particularly useful when you've made multiple unrelated changes to a single file and want to commit them separately for clarity and maintainability.

To initiate interactive staging, use the command `git add -p <file>` or `git add --patch <file>`. Git will then present you with each "hunk" (a contiguous block of changes) and ask whether you want to stage it. You'll be presented with a series of options, such as `y` (yes, stage this hunk), `n` (no, don't stage this hunk), `s` (split the hunk into smaller hunks), `e` (manually edit the hunk), and more.

For example, imagine you've modified a configuration file, adding a new feature flag and fixing a typo. Using `git add -p config.ini`, you can choose to stage only the feature flag addition in one commit and the typo fix in another, resulting in cleaner and more focused commit messages. This level of control ensures that your commit history accurately reflects the logical progression of your work.
