Rebasing is a powerful tool in Git, but it's crucial to understand when it's appropriate and when it can lead to problems. Generally, you should rebase when you want to integrate changes from another branch into your current branch _before_ you push your changes to a shared remote repository. This helps maintain a cleaner, linear project history. A common scenario is rebasing your feature branch onto the `main` branch to incorporate the latest changes before submitting a pull request. This avoids merge commits and makes the history easier to follow.

However, the golden rule of rebasing is: **never rebase commits that have already been pushed to a public repository.** Rebasing rewrites history, and if others have based their work on those commits, rebasing will create divergent histories and lead to significant merge conflicts and confusion. Imagine you've pushed a branch `feature/my-feature` and a colleague has started working on a branch `feature/my-feature-extension` based on your `feature/my-feature`. If you then rebase `feature/my-feature`, your colleague will have a very difficult time integrating their changes.

In summary, rebase local, unpushed branches frequently to keep them up-to-date. Avoid rebasing branches that are shared with others. If you're unsure, err on the side of caution and use `merge` instead.
