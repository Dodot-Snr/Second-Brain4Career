Choosing between Git submodules and subtrees depends heavily on your project's needs and how tightly coupled you want the external project to be. Submodules are essentially pointers to specific commits in another repository. They keep the external project separate, making updates to the submodule's code independent of the main project. This is ideal when you need to include a library or component that is actively developed and maintained separately, and you want to track specific versions of it. For example, using a submodule for a third-party library that you occasionally update but don't directly modify.

Subtrees, on the other hand, merge the entire history of the external project into your main project's repository. This creates a single, unified history. Subtrees are a good choice when you want to make modifications to the included project directly within your main project's repository, or when you want to avoid the complexities of managing separate submodule repositories. Imagine you're incorporating a configuration file repository that you intend to customize heavily for your specific application. A subtree would allow you to directly modify and track those changes within your main project's history.

Ultimately, the decision hinges on the level of integration and control you require over the external project. Submodules offer separation and version tracking, while subtrees provide a unified history and easier modification within the main project.
