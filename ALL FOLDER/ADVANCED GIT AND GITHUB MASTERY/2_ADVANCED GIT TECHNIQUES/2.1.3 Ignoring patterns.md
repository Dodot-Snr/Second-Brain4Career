Once you have a `.gitignore` file in place, you need to define the patterns that Git should use to determine which files to ignore. These patterns are specified using a simple syntax that allows for flexible and powerful exclusion rules. Understanding how to write effective ignore patterns is crucial for keeping your repository clean and focused on relevant code.

The basic syntax involves specifying filenames or directory names. You can use wildcards like `*` (matches zero or more characters), `?` (matches a single character), and `[]` (matches a character within a range). A leading `/` anchors the pattern to the root of the repository, while a trailing `/` indicates a directory. A `!` negates a pattern, allowing you to re-include files that would otherwise be ignored.

For example, to ignore all `.log` files, you would add `*.log` to your `.gitignore`. To ignore an entire directory named `build`, you would add `build/`. If you accidentally ignored all `.txt` files but want to include `important.txt`, you would add `!important.txt` after the `*.txt` rule. These patterns are evaluated in order, so the order of your rules matters.
