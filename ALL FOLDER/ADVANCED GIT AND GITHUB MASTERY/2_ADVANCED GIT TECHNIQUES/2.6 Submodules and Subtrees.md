Submodules and subtrees are both mechanisms for including external projects within your Git repository. They address the need to manage dependencies or incorporate shared codebases. However, they differ significantly in how they integrate the external project and how changes are managed. Submodules essentially create a pointer within your main repository to a specific commit in another repository. This means the submodule retains its own Git history and is treated as a separate entity.

Subtrees, on the other hand, merge the entire history of the external project directly into your main repository. This creates a subdirectory containing the external project's code, but it becomes part of your repository's history. While submodules maintain a clear separation, subtrees offer a more integrated approach.

For example, imagine you're building a website that uses a third-party JavaScript library. Using a submodule, you'd add the library's repository as a submodule. Updates to the library would require you to update the submodule pointer in your main repository. With a subtree, you'd merge the library's code into a subdirectory. Updates would involve pulling changes from the library's repository and merging them into your subtree directory. A common use case for subtrees is vendoring dependencies, where you want to ensure a specific version of a library is always available within your project, even if the original library repository disappears.
