Git is not just for code! It's an excellent tool for version controlling and collaborating on documentation. Storing documentation alongside your code offers numerous benefits, including keeping documentation synchronized with specific code versions, facilitating collaborative editing, and leveraging Git's powerful history tracking. You can use various formats like Markdown, reStructuredText, or even plain text files. The key is to choose a format that's easily readable and editable directly within the repository.

A common example is storing project documentation in a `docs/` directory at the root of your repository. This directory can contain Markdown files explaining the project's architecture, API usage, or contribution guidelines. Another example is using Git to manage a project's website, often built with static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo. The source files for the website, including content and templates, are stored in Git, allowing for easy updates and rollbacks.

By storing documentation in Git, you can ensure that your documentation is always up-to-date with the latest code changes. Furthermore, you can use Git's branching and merging capabilities to collaborate on documentation updates with your team, just like you would with code. This approach promotes a culture of documentation as code, making it an integral part of the development process.
