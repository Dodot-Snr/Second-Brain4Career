Automated testing is a cornerstone of modern software development, and integrating it into your Git and GitHub workflow is crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. This involves setting up systems that automatically run your test suite whenever changes are pushed to a repository, providing immediate feedback on whether the new code has introduced any issues. This proactive approach helps catch bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later.

One common approach is to use Continuous Integration (CI) tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI. These tools can be configured to listen for specific Git events, such as a push to a branch or a pull request being opened. Upon detecting such an event, the CI tool will execute a predefined set of steps, typically including building your project, running your tests, and reporting the results. For example, a GitHub Actions workflow might run your Python unit tests using `pytest` every time a commit is pushed to the `main` branch.

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python 3.9
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests with pytest
        run: pytest
```

Another example is using pre-commit hooks. These hooks run locally before you even commit your code, allowing you to catch simple errors like style issues or missing imports before they are pushed to the remote repository. This helps maintain a consistent code style and prevents trivial errors from cluttering the CI pipeline.
