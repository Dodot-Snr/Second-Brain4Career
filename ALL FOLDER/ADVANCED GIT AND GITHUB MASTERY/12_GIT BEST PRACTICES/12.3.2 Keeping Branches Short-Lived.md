Short-lived branches are a cornerstone of efficient Git workflows, particularly when practicing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). The core idea is to create branches for small, focused tasks and merge them back into the main branch (usually `main` or `develop`) as quickly as possible. This approach minimizes the risk of merge conflicts, simplifies code review, and promotes a faster development cycle.

By keeping branches short-lived, you reduce the divergence between your feature branch and the main branch. This makes merging easier and less prone to errors. For example, instead of working on a large feature for weeks in a single branch, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks, each with its own branch. A branch to update the UI button color, and another to implement the API call for the button. This also encourages more frequent integration, allowing you to catch and resolve integration issues early on.

Consider a scenario where you're adding a new user authentication feature. Instead of creating a single branch for the entire feature, you could create separate branches for: (1) implementing the user registration form, (2) implementing the login functionality, and (3) integrating with a third-party authentication provider. Each of these branches would be relatively small and focused, making them easier to review, test, and merge. This approach also allows for more frequent deployments, as each small feature can be deployed independently once it's merged into the main branch.
