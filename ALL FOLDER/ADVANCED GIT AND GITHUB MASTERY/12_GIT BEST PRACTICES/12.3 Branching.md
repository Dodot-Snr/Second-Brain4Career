Branching is a fundamental concept in Git that allows you to diverge from the main line of development (usually `main` or `master`) and work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation. This isolation prevents unstable code from affecting the main codebase and allows for parallel development by multiple team members. Think of it like creating a separate timeline for your project, where you can make changes without impacting the original timeline until you're ready to merge them back together.

Branches are lightweight and easy to create. A branch is essentially a pointer to a specific commit in your repository's history. When you create a new branch, Git creates a new pointer that points to the same commit as the branch you branched from. As you make changes and commit them on the new branch, the branch pointer moves forward, diverging from the original branch. For example, you might create a branch called `feature/new-login` to develop a new login feature. All your commits related to the new login will be isolated to this branch.

A common workflow involves creating a branch for each new feature or bug fix. Once the work on the branch is complete and tested, it can be merged back into the main branch. This process ensures that the main branch remains stable and that new features are integrated in a controlled manner. For instance, after thoroughly testing the `feature/new-login` branch, you would merge it back into the `main` branch, incorporating the new login feature into the main codebase.
