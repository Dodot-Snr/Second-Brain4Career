Managing infrastructure with Git, often referred to as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) within the GitOps paradigm, involves defining and managing your infrastructure (servers, networks, databases, etc.) using code stored in Git repositories. This approach allows you to treat your infrastructure configuration just like any other software code, enabling version control, collaboration, automated testing, and repeatable deployments. Instead of manually configuring servers or using imperative scripts, you declare the desired state of your infrastructure in configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON, Terraform configurations) and Git becomes the single source of truth.

The core principle is that any changes to your infrastructure are made through Git commits and pull requests. Automated processes then detect these changes and reconcile the actual infrastructure state with the desired state defined in the Git repository. This ensures consistency, auditability, and the ability to easily roll back to previous versions if needed. This declarative approach significantly reduces the risk of human error and configuration drift, leading to more reliable and predictable infrastructure management.

For example, you might define your AWS EC2 instances and networking configurations using Terraform files stored in a Git repository. When you update the Terraform files to increase the instance size and merge the changes, a CI/CD pipeline automatically applies these changes to your AWS environment, bringing it into alignment with the new desired state. Another example is using Kubernetes manifests stored in Git to define your application deployments and services. Changes to these manifests trigger automated deployments, ensuring your applications are always running with the desired configuration.
