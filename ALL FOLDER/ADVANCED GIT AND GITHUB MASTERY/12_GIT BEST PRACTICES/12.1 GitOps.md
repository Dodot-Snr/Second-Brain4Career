GitOps is a modern approach to continuous deployment that leverages Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configurations. Instead of manually deploying changes or relying on complex CI/CD pipelines to push updates, GitOps uses automated operators to continuously reconcile the desired state defined in Git with the actual state of the system. This ensures that the infrastructure and applications are always in sync with the Git repository, providing increased reliability, auditability, and faster deployment cycles.

The core principle of GitOps is that the entire system's desired state is described declaratively in Git. Any changes to the system are made by modifying the Git repository, and automated operators then detect these changes and apply them to the target environment. This "pull-based" approach contrasts with traditional "push-based" deployments, where CI/CD pipelines push changes to the infrastructure.

For example, imagine you want to deploy a new version of your application. In a GitOps workflow, you would update the application's deployment manifest in your Git repository. A GitOps operator, such as Argo CD or Flux, would then detect this change and automatically deploy the new version to your Kubernetes cluster. Another example is managing infrastructure as code. You could define your entire infrastructure (e.g., virtual machines, networks, databases) in Terraform configuration files stored in Git. Changes to these files would trigger the GitOps operator to provision or modify the infrastructure accordingly.
