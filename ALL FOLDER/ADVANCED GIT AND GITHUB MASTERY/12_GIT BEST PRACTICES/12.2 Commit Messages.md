Commit messages are short, descriptive notes that accompany each commit in your Git repository. They serve as a historical record of changes, explaining _why_ a change was made, not just _what_ was changed. Well-crafted commit messages are crucial for collaboration, code review, and understanding the evolution of a project over time. They help developers quickly grasp the purpose of a commit without having to delve into the code itself.

A good commit message follows a specific structure. The first line should be a concise summary (50 characters or less) acting as the title. This is followed by a blank line, and then a more detailed explanation in the body, wrapped to around 72 characters per line. The body can provide context, reasoning, and any relevant information about the changes. Using imperative mood ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug") is a common convention.

For example, a simple fix might have a commit message like this:

```
Fix: Prevent crash when loading invalid data

The application was crashing when attempting to load data
that didn't conform to the expected schema. This commit
implements validation to ensure data integrity and prevent
the crash.
```

A more complex feature implementation might include details about the approach taken, alternative solutions considered, and any potential trade-offs.
