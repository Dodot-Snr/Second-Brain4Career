Code reviews are a critical part of the software development lifecycle, especially when working collaboratively using Git and GitHub. They involve examining code changes proposed in a pull request to identify potential bugs, ensure code quality, enforce coding standards, and share knowledge among team members. Effective code reviews lead to more robust, maintainable, and understandable codebases.

The process typically involves a reviewer examining the changes introduced in a pull request, providing feedback on aspects like code clarity, efficiency, potential security vulnerabilities, and adherence to project guidelines. For example, a reviewer might suggest refactoring a complex function into smaller, more manageable units or point out a potential null pointer exception. Consider this Python example:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
  if len(numbers) == 0:
    return 0
  total = sum(numbers)
  return total / len(numbers)
```

A code review might suggest adding a check to ensure `numbers` is not `None` to prevent a `TypeError`. The reviewer might also suggest using `statistics.mean(numbers)` for a more concise and potentially optimized solution. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the code before it's merged into the main branch.
