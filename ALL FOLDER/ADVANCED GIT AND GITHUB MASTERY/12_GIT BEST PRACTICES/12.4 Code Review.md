Code review is a critical practice in collaborative software development where peers examine each other's code changes before they are merged into the main codebase. This process helps identify potential bugs, improve code quality, enforce coding standards, and share knowledge among team members. Effective code reviews lead to more robust, maintainable, and understandable software.

The primary goal of code review is to catch errors and improve the overall quality of the code. This includes identifying logical errors, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and stylistic inconsistencies. For example, a reviewer might spot a missing input validation that could lead to a security vulnerability, or they might suggest a more efficient algorithm to improve performance. Another key benefit is knowledge sharing. Reviewing code exposes team members to different approaches and techniques, fostering a shared understanding of the codebase.

Consider a scenario where a developer introduces a new feature. Before merging the code, a reviewer might notice that the new code doesn't handle edge cases properly, such as empty input or unexpected data types. They would then provide feedback, prompting the developer to address these issues before the code is integrated. Another example is ensuring consistent coding style. A reviewer might point out that the new code uses a different naming convention than the rest of the project, ensuring that the codebase remains consistent and readable.
