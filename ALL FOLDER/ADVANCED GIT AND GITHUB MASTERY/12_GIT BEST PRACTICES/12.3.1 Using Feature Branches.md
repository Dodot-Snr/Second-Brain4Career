Feature branches are a cornerstone of modern Git workflows, allowing developers to isolate new features or bug fixes from the main codebase (typically `main` or `develop`) until they are ready for integration. This isolation prevents unstable or incomplete code from impacting the stability of the primary branch. The process involves creating a new branch specifically for the feature, making changes on that branch, and then merging it back into the main branch once the feature is complete and tested.

The primary benefit of feature branches is parallel development. Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. This significantly speeds up the development process and reduces the risk of introducing bugs. Furthermore, feature branches facilitate code review. Before merging a feature branch, it can be reviewed by other team members to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.

For example, if you're adding a new user authentication system, you would create a branch named `feature/user-auth`. All code related to user authentication would be committed to this branch. Once the feature is complete and tested, a pull request would be created to merge `feature/user-auth` into `main`. Another example would be fixing a bug related to order processing. A branch named `bugfix/order-processing` would be created, the bug fixed, and then merged back into `main` after verification.
