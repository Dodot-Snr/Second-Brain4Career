Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development, focusing on testing individual components or units of code in isolation. The goal is to verify that each unit of the software performs as designed. This involves writing small, focused tests that exercise specific functions, methods, or classes, ensuring they produce the expected output for a given input. By isolating and testing individual units, developers can quickly identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

A key aspect of unit testing is the use of assertions. Assertions are statements that check whether a specific condition is true. If the condition is false, the test fails, indicating a problem with the unit under test. For example, if you have a function that adds two numbers, a unit test might assert that `add(2, 3)` returns `5`. Another example could be testing a function that validates email addresses. A unit test might assert that `validate_email("test@example.com")` returns `True` and `validate_email("invalid-email")` returns `False`.

Effective unit tests should be automated, repeatable, and independent. They should also cover a wide range of scenarios, including positive and negative cases, edge cases, and boundary conditions. By writing comprehensive unit tests, developers can build confidence in their code and reduce the risk of introducing bugs during future modifications.
