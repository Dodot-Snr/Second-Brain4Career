Integration tests verify that different parts of your application work correctly together. Unlike unit tests, which focus on isolated components, integration tests examine the interactions between modules, services, or even external systems. This type of testing is crucial for ensuring that your code functions as expected in a real-world environment, catching issues that might arise from miscommunication or incorrect data flow between components.

A common example is testing the interaction between your application's API and its database. An integration test might involve sending a request to create a new user via the API and then verifying that the user data is correctly stored in the database. Another example could be testing the interaction between two microservices. You might simulate a request to one service that triggers a call to another service and then verify that the expected outcome is achieved across both services.

Writing effective integration tests often involves setting up a test environment that closely mirrors your production environment. This might include using a test database, mocking external services, or configuring specific network settings. While integration tests can be more complex and time-consuming to write than unit tests, they provide a higher level of confidence in the overall functionality of your application.
