Pulling from remotes is how you integrate changes from a remote repository into your local repository. It's essentially a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`. When you pull, Git first fetches the latest changes from the specified remote branch and then automatically merges those changes into your current local branch. This is a common operation for keeping your local repository synchronized with the work of others or with updates made to the remote repository.

The most common command for pulling is `git pull origin <branch_name>`. This command fetches the specified branch from the `origin` remote and merges it into your currently active branch. For example, if you're working on the `main` branch locally and want to update it with the latest changes from the `origin/main` branch, you would run `git pull origin main`. Git will then download the changes and attempt to merge them into your local `main` branch.

Sometimes, pulling can result in merge conflicts if there are conflicting changes between your local branch and the remote branch. In such cases, you'll need to resolve the conflicts manually by editing the affected files, marking the conflicts as resolved, and then committing the changes. For example, after running `git pull origin main` you might see a message indicating merge conflicts. You would then open the conflicted files, resolve the conflicts, stage the changes using `git add`, and finally commit the resolved merge with `git commit`.
