`git diff` is a powerful command that allows you to inspect the differences between various states of your Git repository. It's essential for understanding what changes you've made, reviewing code, and debugging issues. At its core, `git diff` compares two sources and outputs the differences in a human-readable format, often referred to as a "patch." These sources can be your working directory, the staging area (index), a specific commit, or even different branches. Understanding how to use `git diff` effectively is crucial for maintaining a clean and understandable codebase.

The most common use case is to see the changes you've made in your working directory that haven't yet been staged. Simply running `git diff` will show you these modifications. Another frequent use is to compare staged changes with the last commit using `git diff --staged` (or `git diff --cached` for older Git versions). This allows you to review exactly what you're about to commit. You can also compare specific commits using `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`, which will show the differences between those two points in your project's history.

For example, if you want to see the changes between your current working directory and the last commit, you can use:

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

Or, to see the differences between two specific commits:

```bash
git diff a1b2c3d4 e5f6g7h8
```
