Sometimes, your working directory accumulates untracked files â€“ build artifacts, temporary files, or accidentally created documents. While `git reset` and `git checkout` help undo changes to tracked files, `git clean` is the command you use to remove these untracked files from your working directory. It's a powerful tool, but also potentially destructive, so understanding its options and using it with caution is crucial.

`git clean` offers several options to control its behavior. The `-n` (or `--dry-run`) option is your friend; it shows you what _would_ be removed without actually deleting anything. The `-f` (or `--force`) option is required to actually perform the deletion, unless `clean.requireForce` is set to `false` in your Git configuration. The `-d` option removes untracked directories as well, and `-x` removes files ignored by `.gitignore`.

For example, to see what untracked files and directories would be removed, you'd run:

```bash
git clean -n -d
```

Then, to actually remove them, you'd use:

```bash
git clean -f -d
```

Remember to always double-check the output of the dry-run before executing the actual deletion!
