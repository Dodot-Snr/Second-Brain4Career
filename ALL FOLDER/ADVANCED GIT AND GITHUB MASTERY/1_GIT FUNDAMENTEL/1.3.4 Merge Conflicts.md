Merge conflicts arise when Git encounters conflicting changes between branches during a merge or rebase operation. This typically happens when the same lines in a file have been modified differently in two branches, and Git cannot automatically determine which changes to incorporate. Resolving these conflicts is a crucial skill for collaborative development.

When a merge conflict occurs, Git marks the conflicting sections in the affected file with special conflict markers: `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch_name`. The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents the changes from the current branch (HEAD), while the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch_name` represents the changes from the branch being merged.

For example, imagine two developers working on the same `README.md` file. One developer, on the `feature/new-feature` branch, adds a new section about the feature. Simultaneously, the other developer, on the `main` branch, corrects a typo in the same section. When attempting to merge `feature/new-feature` into `main`, a merge conflict will occur in the `README.md` file. To resolve it, you would manually edit the file, choosing which changes to keep, or combining them as needed, and then remove the conflict markers before committing the resolved file.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the original README file with a typo.
=======
This is the original README file with a new feature added.
>>>>>>> feature/new-feature
```
