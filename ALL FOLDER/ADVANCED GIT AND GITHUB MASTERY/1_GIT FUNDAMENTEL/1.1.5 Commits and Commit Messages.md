Commits are the fundamental building blocks of a Git repository. They represent snapshots of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit contains the changes made since the last commit, along with metadata like the author, committer, timestamp, and, most importantly, a commit message. Understanding how to create effective commits and write informative commit messages is crucial for maintaining a clean, understandable, and collaborative project history.

A well-crafted commit message serves as a concise explanation of _why_ the changes were made, not just _what_ was changed. This context is invaluable for future developers (including your future self!) who need to understand the reasoning behind specific modifications. A good commit message typically follows a standard format: a short, descriptive subject line (ideally under 50 characters), followed by a blank line, and then a more detailed body explaining the "why" and any relevant context.

For example, instead of a commit message like "Fixed bug," a better message would be:

```
Fix: Prevented crash when processing invalid user input

The application was crashing when encountering malformed data in the user input field. This commit implements input validation to sanitize the data before processing, preventing the crash and improving application stability.
```

This example clearly states the problem, the solution, and the reasoning behind the fix. This level of detail makes it easier to understand the commit's purpose and impact, even months or years later.
