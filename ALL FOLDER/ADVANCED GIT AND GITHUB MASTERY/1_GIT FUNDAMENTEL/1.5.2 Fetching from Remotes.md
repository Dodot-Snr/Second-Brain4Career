Fetching from remotes is a crucial aspect of collaborating with others using Git and GitHub. Unlike `git pull`, which both fetches and merges changes, `git fetch` only downloads the latest commits, branches, and tags from a remote repository into your local repository. This allows you to inspect the changes before deciding whether and how to integrate them into your working branch. It's a safe way to stay updated without automatically altering your local code.

Fetching is particularly useful when you want to review what others have been working on without immediately merging their changes. For example, you might fetch updates from the `origin` remote using `git fetch origin`. This will update your local tracking branches (like `origin/main`) with the latest commits from the `main` branch on the `origin` remote. You can then use commands like `git log origin/main` to examine the changes before deciding to merge them into your local `main` branch.

Another common use case is fetching a specific branch from a remote. Suppose a colleague has been working on a feature branch called `feature/new-design` on the `upstream` remote. You can fetch this branch with `git fetch upstream feature/new-design`. This will create a local reference to the remote branch, allowing you to inspect the code and potentially merge it into your local branch using `git merge upstream/feature/new-design`.
