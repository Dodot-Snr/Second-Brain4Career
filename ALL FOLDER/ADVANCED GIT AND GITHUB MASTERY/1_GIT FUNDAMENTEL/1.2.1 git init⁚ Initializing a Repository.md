The `git init` command is the cornerstone of any Git project. It's the first command you'll use to create a new Git repository. Essentially, `git init` transforms a regular directory into a Git repository by creating a hidden `.git` subdirectory. This `.git` directory is where Git stores all the metadata and object database for your repository. Without it, Git cannot track changes or manage versions.

When you run `git init`, Git initializes the repository with a default branch (usually `main` or `master`, depending on your Git configuration). You can then start adding files to your project, staging them, and committing them to the repository. It's important to note that `git init` only needs to be run once per project.

For example, to initialize a new Git repository in a directory called "my_project", you would navigate to that directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
cd my_project
git init
```

Alternatively, you can create the directory and initialize the repository in one step:

```bash
git init my_project
cd my_project
```
