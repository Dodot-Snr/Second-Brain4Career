Understanding how Git stores data is crucial for advanced usage. Unlike some version control systems that track changes as a series of _differences_ between files, Git uses a _snapshot_ approach. Each commit in Git records a complete snapshot of all files in your project at that point in time. This means that Git doesn't just store what changed, but the entire state of every file. This design choice has significant implications for performance and branching.

While Git stores snapshots, it's also smart about storage efficiency. If a file hasn't changed between commits, Git doesn't store a completely new copy. Instead, it stores a reference to the previous version of the file. This is why Git can be so fast, even with large projects. For example, if you have a large image file that remains unchanged across multiple commits, Git only stores the image once and then references it in subsequent commits.

To illustrate, consider a simple text file `README.md`. In the first commit, Git stores a complete snapshot of `README.md`. If you then edit `README.md` and commit again, Git stores a new snapshot. However, if you create a new file `LICENSE` and commit, Git stores a snapshot of `LICENSE` and _references_ the original `README.md` if it hasn't changed. This snapshot-based approach, combined with efficient storage, is a core concept to grasp for mastering Git.
