Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. It's a fundamental operation in Git that allows you to combine work done in parallel, bringing features, bug fixes, or other modifications into your main codebase or other feature branches. Understanding different merge strategies and how to resolve conflicts is crucial for effective collaboration and maintaining a clean project history.

The most common type of merge is a "fast-forward" merge, which occurs when the target branch has no new commits since the source branch diverged. In this case, Git simply moves the target branch pointer to the latest commit of the source branch. However, if the target branch _does_ have new commits, Git performs a "three-way merge." This involves creating a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches. Git automatically identifies common ancestors and attempts to integrate the changes.

For example, imagine you have a `feature/new-button` branch and you want to merge it into your `develop` branch. After ensuring you're on the `develop` branch (`git checkout develop`), you would run `git merge feature/new-button`. If there are no conflicts, Git will automatically merge the changes. If conflicts arise (e.g., the same line of code was modified in both branches), you'll need to manually resolve them by editing the conflicting files, marking them as resolved with `git add`, and then committing the merge.

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge feature/new-button
```
