`git revert` is a powerful command for undoing changes in your Git repository while preserving the project's history. Unlike `git reset`, which modifies the existing history, `git revert` creates a _new_ commit that effectively undoes the changes introduced by a specific commit. This is particularly useful when working in collaborative environments where rewriting history can cause problems for other developers.

When you run `git revert <commit-hash>`, Git will analyze the changes made by the specified commit and create a new commit that applies the _opposite_ changes. This effectively undoes the original commit's effects. The new commit will have a default commit message indicating that it's a revert, but you can customize it. This approach ensures that the history remains intact, making it easier to track changes and collaborate with others.

For example, if commit `a1b2c3d` introduced a bug, you can use `git revert a1b2c3d` to create a new commit that removes the bug. The original commit `a1b2c3d` will still be in the history, but its effects will be negated by the revert commit. If you need to revert a range of commits, you can use `git revert <commit-hash-start>..<commit-hash-end>`. Git will then revert each commit in the specified range, creating a new commit for each reverted commit.
