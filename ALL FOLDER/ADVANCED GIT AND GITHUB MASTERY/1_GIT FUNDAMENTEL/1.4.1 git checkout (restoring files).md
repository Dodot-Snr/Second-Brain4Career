`git checkout` is a versatile command, and when discussing undoing changes, it's crucial for understanding how to restore individual files to a previous state. Unlike `git revert` or `git reset`, `git checkout` in this context doesn't affect the commit history. Instead, it allows you to selectively discard changes made to a file in your working directory or staging area, effectively reverting it to the version present in a specific commit or branch. This is particularly useful when you've made accidental edits or want to quickly undo local modifications without altering the project's history.

The primary use case is restoring a file from the staging area or working directory to the state it was in at the last commit. For example, if you've accidentally modified `my_file.txt` and want to undo those changes, you can use `git checkout -- my_file.txt`. This will overwrite the current version of `my_file.txt` in your working directory with the version from the `HEAD` commit (your last commit). You can also restore a file from a specific commit using `git checkout <commit-hash> -- my_file.txt`. This will restore `my_file.txt` to the state it was in at the specified commit. Remember that these changes are made directly to your working directory and staging area, so you'll need to commit them to persist the restoration.

For example, to restore `index.html` to the version in the commit with hash `a1b2c3d4`, you would run:

```bash
git checkout a1b2c3d4 -- index.html
```

After running this command, `index.html` in your working directory will be identical to the version in commit `a1b2c3d4`. You can then stage and commit this change to permanently revert the file.
