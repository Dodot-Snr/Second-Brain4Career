This section lays the foundation for your advanced Git journey by solidifying your understanding of fundamental Git commands. We'll review the core commands used for tracking changes, committing them to your local repository, and managing the staging area. Mastering these basics is crucial before diving into more complex workflows and features. Think of this as your Git command vocabulary – you need to know the words before you can write the story!

We'll cover commands like `git init` (to initialize a new repository), `git add` (to stage changes), `git commit` (to record changes to the repository), `git status` (to view the state of the working directory and staging area), and `git log` (to view the commit history). Understanding how these commands interact is key to effectively managing your code and collaborating with others.

For example, after making changes to a file named `my_file.txt`, you would first use `git add my_file.txt` to stage the changes. Then, you would use `git commit -m "Updated my_file.txt"` to commit the staged changes with a descriptive message. These simple steps are the building blocks of version control.
