The `git commit` command is the cornerstone of Git version control. It's how you save snapshots of your staged changes to your local repository. Think of it as taking a picture of the current state of your project and storing it in Git's history. Each commit has a unique ID (SHA-1 hash), a message describing the changes, and information about the author and timestamp. Without commits, your changes exist only in your working directory and staging area, not yet part of the permanent record.

To create a commit, you first need to stage your changes using `git add`. Then, you use `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"`. The `-m` flag allows you to write the commit message directly in the command line. A good commit message is crucial for understanding the history of your project. It should be concise but informative, explaining _why_ the changes were made, not just _what_ was changed. For example, instead of "Fixed bug," a better message would be "Fix: Resolved issue where user profile images were not loading due to incorrect file path."

Here's a simple example:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement user authentication with email and password"
```

This command stages all changes in the current directory and creates a commit with the message "feat: Implement user authentication with email and password". The "feat" prefix is a common convention indicating that this commit introduces a new feature.
