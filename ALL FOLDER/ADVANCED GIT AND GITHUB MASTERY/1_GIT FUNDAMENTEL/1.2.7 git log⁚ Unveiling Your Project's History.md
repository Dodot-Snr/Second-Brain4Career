`git log` is your time machine for exploring the history of your Git repository. It displays a chronological list of commits, providing valuable information about each change, including the author, date, commit message, and a unique SHA-1 hash. Understanding how to effectively use `git log` is crucial for debugging, understanding project evolution, and collaborating effectively.

The basic `git log` command provides a wealth of information, but it can be overwhelming. You can customize the output using various flags. For example, `git log --oneline` condenses each commit to a single line, showing only the commit hash and message, making it easier to scan. Another useful option is `git log -n <number>`, which limits the output to the specified number of commits. For instance, `git log -n 5` will display the last 5 commits.

Here are a couple of examples:

- To view a concise history:
    
    ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```
    
- To view the last 3 commits with full details:
    
    ```bash
    git log -n 3
    ```
