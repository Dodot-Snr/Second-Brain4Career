`git reset` is a powerful command used to undo changes, primarily affecting the staging area and commit history. It allows you to move the HEAD pointer to a previous commit, effectively rewinding your project's state. Understanding the different reset types (soft, mixed, and hard) is crucial for using it safely and effectively. Be cautious when using `git reset`, especially the `hard` option, as it can lead to data loss if not used carefully.

The three main types of `git reset` are:

- **`git reset --soft <commit>`:** Moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit, but leaves the staging area and working directory untouched. This means all changes since the specified commit are still present in the staging area, ready to be committed.
- **`git reset --mixed <commit>`:** (This is the default if no option is specified) Moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit and unstages the changes. The changes are still present in the working directory, but they are no longer staged for commit.
- **`git reset --hard <commit>`:** Moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit, unstages all changes, and overwrites the working directory to match the specified commit. This is the most destructive option and should be used with extreme caution.

For example, if you accidentally committed changes to the wrong branch and want to move them to a new branch, you could use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the last commit while keeping the changes staged. Then, you can create a new branch and commit the changes there. Alternatively, if you want to completely discard the last commit and all its changes, you could use `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.
