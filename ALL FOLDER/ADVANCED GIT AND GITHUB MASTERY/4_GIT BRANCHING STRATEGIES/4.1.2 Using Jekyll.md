Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text into static websites and blogs. It's particularly well-suited for GitHub Pages because GitHub natively supports Jekyll, meaning you can host your Jekyll site directly from a GitHub repository without needing a separate web server. This makes it incredibly easy to deploy and manage simple websites, documentation, or personal blogs. Jekyll uses Markdown (or Textile) for content creation and Liquid for templating, allowing you to create dynamic-looking sites with static content.

To use Jekyll with GitHub Pages, you simply create a repository with your Jekyll project. GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to the `main` or `master` branch (or a branch specified in your repository settings). A basic Jekyll site structure includes directories for `_layouts`, `_posts`, `_includes`, and an `index.md` or `index.html` file. The `_posts` directory is where you store your blog posts, named according to the `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` convention.

For example, a simple blog post might look like this:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "My First Jekyll Post"
date: 2023-10-27
---

This is the content of my first Jekyll post! I'm using Markdown to format it.
```

And a basic layout file (`_layouts/default.html`) might contain:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
  {{ content }}
</body>
</html>
```

This demonstrates how Jekyll uses Liquid templating (`{{ page.title }}` and `{{ content }}`) to dynamically insert content into your layouts.
