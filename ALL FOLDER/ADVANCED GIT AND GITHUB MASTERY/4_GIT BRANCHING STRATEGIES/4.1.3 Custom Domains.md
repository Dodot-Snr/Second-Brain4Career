GitHub Pages provides a simple and free way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. While the default URL structure ([username.github.io/repository](http://username.github.io/repository)) is convenient, using a custom domain (like [yourname.com](http://yourname.com)) adds a professional touch and enhances your brand. Configuring a custom domain involves pointing your domain's DNS records to GitHub's servers and informing GitHub Pages about your domain. This allows visitors to access your website through your chosen domain name.

The process typically involves adding an `A` record pointing to GitHub's IP addresses (e.g., `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`) and a `CNAME` record pointing to your GitHub Pages URL ([username.github.io](http://username.github.io)). You then create a `CNAME` file in the root of your GitHub Pages repository containing your custom domain name. For example, if your domain is `example.com`, the `CNAME` file would simply contain `example.com`.

Once configured, GitHub Pages automatically handles SSL certificates for your custom domain, ensuring secure HTTPS connections. This seamless integration makes using custom domains with GitHub Pages a powerful and user-friendly option for deploying professional-looking websites.
