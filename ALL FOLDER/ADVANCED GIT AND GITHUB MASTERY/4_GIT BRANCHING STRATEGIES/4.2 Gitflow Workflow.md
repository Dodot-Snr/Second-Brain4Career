Gitflow is a branching model designed for managing software releases, particularly well-suited for projects with a scheduled release cycle. It defines a strict branching strategy centered around two main branches: `main` (or `master`) and `develop`. The `main` branch always reflects the production-ready code, while `develop` serves as the integration branch for features. Feature development occurs in separate feature branches branched off `develop`, ensuring isolated development and preventing direct commits to the main integration branch.

Releases are prepared in release branches branched off `develop`. This allows for final bug fixes and metadata adjustments before merging into both `main` (tagged with the release version) and `develop`. Hotfixes, for critical bug fixes in production, are branched off `main`, fixed, and then merged back into both `main` and `develop` (or `release` branch if one exists). This structured approach provides a clear and organized way to manage code changes, releases, and hotfixes, making it easier to track and maintain different versions of the software.

For example, imagine a new feature called "User Authentication" is being developed. A developer would create a branch named `feature/user-authentication` off of `develop`. Once the feature is complete and tested, it's merged back into `develop`. When it's time for a new release (e.g., version 2.0), a `release/2.0` branch is created from `develop`. After final testing and bug fixes on the `release/2.0` branch, it's merged into both `main` (tagged as `v2.0`) and `develop`.
