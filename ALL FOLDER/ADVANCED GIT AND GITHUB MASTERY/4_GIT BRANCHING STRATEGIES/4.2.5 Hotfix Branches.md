Hotfix branches are a crucial component of the Gitflow workflow, designed to quickly address critical bugs or issues in the production environment. These branches diverge from the `main` branch at a specific tag that marks the production release. The primary goal is to isolate the fix, test it thoroughly, and then merge it back into both `main` and `develop` branches to ensure the fix is included in the next release and development efforts. This allows for immediate remediation without disrupting ongoing feature development.

Imagine a scenario where a critical security vulnerability is discovered in the live application. A hotfix branch is created from the tag representing the current production version. The necessary code changes are made, tested, and committed to the hotfix branch. Once verified, the hotfix branch is merged back into `main` (and tagged with a new version number) for immediate deployment to production. It's also merged into `develop` to ensure the fix is incorporated into the next release cycle.

For example, to create a hotfix branch named `hotfix/v1.0.1` from the `v1.0.0` tag, you would use the following commands:

```bash
git checkout v1.0.0
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.0.1
# Make necessary changes and commit
git commit -am "Fix critical security vulnerability"
```

After committing the fix, the branch would be merged into both `main` and `develop`.
