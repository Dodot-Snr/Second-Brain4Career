GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can use GitHub Pages to host a website about yourself, your organization, or your project directly from a GitHub repository. It's a fantastic way to showcase your work, create project documentation, or build a simple personal website without needing to manage a server.

There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are typically used to document a specific project and are hosted under a subdirectory of your user or organization site. User sites represent your personal website, and organization sites represent the website for your organization. For example, if your GitHub username is `octocat`, your user site would be hosted at `octocat.github.io`.

A common example is using GitHub Pages to host a static website generated by a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo. You would commit your source files (Markdown, templates, etc.) to a repository, configure GitHub Pages to use the generator, and GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes. Another example is hosting a simple HTML portfolio. You could create an `index.html` file, add some CSS and JavaScript, and then enable GitHub Pages on the repository to make your portfolio live.
