Within the Gitflow Workflow, the `master` branch serves as the official release history of your project. It should always reflect a production-ready state, meaning every commit on `master` represents a tagged release. This branch is highly protected and should only be updated through merges from the `release` branch after rigorous testing and approval. Direct commits to `master` are strongly discouraged.

Think of `master` as the definitive record of what's currently deployed and running in production. For example, if you need to quickly revert to a previous version, you can easily check out a specific tag on `master` corresponding to that release. Another example is when you need to create a hotfix. You would branch off of `master` to ensure the hotfix is based on the exact code running in production.

```git
# Example: Tagging a release on master
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
git push origin v1.0
```
