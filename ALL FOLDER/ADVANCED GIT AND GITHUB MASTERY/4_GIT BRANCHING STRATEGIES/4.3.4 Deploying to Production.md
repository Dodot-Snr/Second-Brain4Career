Deploying to production is the final, crucial step in the GitHub Flow. It involves taking the code that has been thoroughly reviewed, tested, and merged into your main branch (typically `main` or `master`) and making it live for your users. This process should be automated as much as possible to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of human error. A well-defined deployment strategy is essential for a smooth and reliable release.

The deployment process often involves several steps, including building the application, running final integration tests, and deploying the built artifacts to your production environment. Tools like CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI) are commonly used to automate these steps. For example, a GitHub Actions workflow could be triggered on every push to the `main` branch, automatically building the application and deploying it to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Consider a web application. After merging a feature branch into `main`, the CI/CD pipeline might run commands like:

```bash
npm run build # Build the application
npm run test # Run integration tests
aws s3 sync ./dist s3://your-production-bucket # Deploy to AWS S3
```

This ensures that every change merged into `main` is automatically deployed, minimizing manual intervention and accelerating the release cycle.
