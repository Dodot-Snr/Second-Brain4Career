GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow designed for teams that deploy regularly. It emphasizes continuous integration and delivery, making it ideal for web development and other projects where frequent updates are common. The core principle revolves around creating a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or experiment, and then merging that branch back into the main branch (typically `main` or `master`) after review and testing.

The process begins by creating a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication` or `bugfix/resolve-login-error`). Work is then committed to this branch. Once the work is complete, a pull request is opened to merge the branch back into `main`. This triggers code review, automated testing, and discussion. Only after the pull request is approved and all tests pass is the branch merged into `main` and deployed.

For example, imagine you're adding a new search feature. You'd create a branch called `feature/search-functionality`, implement the search feature, and then open a pull request. Another developer would review your code, suggest changes, and once approved, the branch would be merged into `main` and deployed. This iterative process ensures code quality and reduces the risk of introducing bugs into the production environment.
