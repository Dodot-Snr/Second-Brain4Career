GitHub Pages allows you to host a website directly from a GitHub repository. This is a fantastic way to showcase your projects, create personal portfolios, or build documentation sites. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or leverage static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, or Next.js to create more complex sites. The beauty of GitHub Pages lies in its simplicity and integration with your existing Git workflow.

There are primarily two types of GitHub Pages sites: user/organization sites and project sites. User/organization sites are hosted from a repository named `<username>.github.io` or `<organization>.github.io` and are typically used for personal or organizational websites. Project sites, on the other hand, are hosted from a branch (usually `gh-pages`) or a `/docs` folder within a project repository. For example, if you have a repository named `my-project`, you can create a `gh-pages` branch and push your website files there. GitHub will then serve your website at `https://<username>.github.io/my-project`.

To get started, simply create a repository, add your website files (e.g., `index.html`, CSS, JavaScript), and configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings. You can choose the source branch or folder for your site. For instance, if you want to use the `main` branch and the `/docs` folder, you would select those options in the GitHub Pages settings. After a few minutes, your site will be live! You can even use a custom domain by adding a `CNAME` file to your repository with your domain name.
