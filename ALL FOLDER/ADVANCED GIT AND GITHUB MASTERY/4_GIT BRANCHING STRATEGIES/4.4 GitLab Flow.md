GitLab Flow is an alternative branching strategy to Gitflow, designed to be simpler and more suitable for continuous delivery. It emphasizes working directly from `main` (or `master`) and using feature branches for new development. Unlike Gitflow, it avoids the need for separate `develop` and `release` branches in many cases, streamlining the workflow. This makes it easier for teams to iterate quickly and deploy frequently.

The core principle of GitLab Flow is that every commit on `main` should be deployable. Feature branches are created from `main`, and merge requests are used to integrate changes. Once a feature is complete and reviewed, it's merged back into `main`. For hotfixes, branches are created from `main`, and after the fix is merged, it's also cherry-picked into any relevant release branches. This ensures that critical fixes are applied to all supported versions.

For example, imagine you're adding a new user authentication feature. You'd create a branch named `feature/user-auth` from `main`, implement the feature, and then create a merge request to merge it back into `main`. Another example: if a critical security vulnerability is discovered, you'd create a branch named `hotfix/security-patch` from `main`, fix the vulnerability, merge it into `main`, and then cherry-pick the commit into any active release branches (e.g., `release/1.2`).

```git
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch main
# ... fix the vulnerability ...
git commit -am "Fix: Security vulnerability"
git push origin hotfix/security-patch

# After merge request is approved and merged to main:
git checkout release/1.2
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-from-main>
git push origin release/1.2
```
