Release branches are a crucial component of the Gitflow workflow, acting as a dedicated space to prepare a new production release. They branch off from the `develop` branch and are primarily used for final bug fixes, metadata adjustments (version numbers, documentation), and other release-related tasks. The key benefit is that they allow the development team to continue working on new features in the `develop` branch without destabilizing the release preparation process.

Once a release branch is created, only critical bug fixes are merged into it. This ensures stability and predictability for the upcoming release. After the release is finalized and deployed to production, the release branch is merged into both `main` (or `master`) and `develop`. Merging into `main` creates a permanent record of the release, while merging into `develop` ensures that any bug fixes made in the release branch are also incorporated into the ongoing development efforts.

For example, imagine you're preparing version 2.0 of your software. You would create a release branch named `release/2.0` from the `develop` branch. On this branch, you might update the version number in your `package.json` file and fix a last-minute bug discovered during testing. Once you're satisfied, you merge `release/2.0` into `main` and tag it as `v2.0`, then merge it back into `develop` to keep the branches synchronized.
