Environment branches are a core component of GitLab Flow, designed to align your Git workflow with your deployment environments. They represent the state of your application in specific environments like staging, pre-production, or production. By creating dedicated branches for each environment, you gain a clear and auditable history of what code is running where. This allows for easier testing, debugging, and rollback procedures.

The typical setup involves branches named after the environments, such as `staging`, `pre-prod`, and `production`. When a feature branch is merged into the `main` branch, it signifies that the code is ready for testing. To deploy to the staging environment, you would merge `main` into the `staging` branch. This triggers a CI/CD pipeline that deploys the code to the staging environment. After successful testing in staging, you can then merge `staging` into `pre-prod` and subsequently `pre-prod` into `production` to promote the code through the deployment pipeline.

For example, imagine a bug is discovered in production. With environment branches, you can easily identify the exact commit that introduced the bug by examining the `production` branch's history. Furthermore, if a hotfix is needed, you can branch directly from `production`, apply the fix, and then merge the hotfix branch back into `production` and subsequently into `pre-prod`, `staging`, and `main` to ensure the fix is propagated throughout your environments. This structured approach minimizes risk and ensures consistency across your deployment pipeline.
