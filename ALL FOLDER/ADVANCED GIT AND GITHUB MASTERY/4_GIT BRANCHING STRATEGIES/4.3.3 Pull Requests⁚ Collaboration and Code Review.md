Pull Requests (PRs) are the heart of collaborative development on GitHub. They are a mechanism to propose changes to a repository, allowing for discussion, review, and automated checks before the changes are integrated into the main codebase. Think of a PR as a formal request to merge your branch into another branch (typically `main` or `develop`). This process ensures code quality, knowledge sharing, and a more robust development workflow.

The PR process involves opening a pull request from your feature branch to the target branch, describing the changes you've made and why. Other developers can then review your code, leave comments, suggest improvements, and even propose changes directly to your branch. Automated checks, such as linters and tests, can also be configured to run automatically on each pull request, providing immediate feedback on code quality and functionality. For example, a PR might include a new feature implementation, like adding user authentication. Another example could be refactoring existing code to improve performance or readability.

Once the review process is complete and all concerns have been addressed, the pull request can be merged. This integrates your changes into the target branch, making them part of the main codebase. The pull request itself serves as a record of the changes, the discussion surrounding them, and the approvals that were given. This history is invaluable for understanding the evolution of the codebase and for future debugging or maintenance.
