In GitLab Flow, hotfix branches are dedicated branches used to quickly address critical bugs or issues in the production environment. These branches deviate from the standard feature branch workflow because they need to be deployed rapidly without waiting for the next scheduled release. The primary goal of a hotfix is to stabilize the production environment as quickly as possible.

The process typically involves branching directly off the `main` branch (which represents the production-ready code), implementing the necessary fix, and then merging the hotfix branch back into both `main` and the `pre-production` branch (or the branch used for the next release). This ensures that the fix is immediately deployed to production and also included in the upcoming release, preventing the bug from reappearing. For example, imagine a critical security vulnerability is discovered in the live website. A hotfix branch would be created, the vulnerability patched, and the fix deployed to production immediately.

Consider this example: a critical bug is found on the live website causing checkout failures. A hotfix branch named `hotfix/checkout-bug` is created from `main`. The bug is fixed on this branch, thoroughly tested, and then merged back into both `main` (for immediate deployment) and `pre-production` (to ensure the fix is included in the next release). This dual merge ensures both immediate resolution and long-term stability.
