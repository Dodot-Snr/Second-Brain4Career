Release branches are a crucial component of GitLab Flow, designed to prepare and stabilize code for production releases. They branch off from the `main` branch (or `master` in some repositories) at a specific point when you're ready to start preparing a release. The primary purpose of a release branch is to allow for final bug fixes, metadata updates (version numbers, documentation), and other release-specific changes without disrupting ongoing development on `main`.

Once a release branch is created (e.g., `release/1.2.0`), only critical bug fixes are merged into it. These fixes are then cherry-picked or merged back into `main` to ensure that the main development line also benefits from these corrections. This process allows developers to continue working on new features and improvements on `main` without the risk of introducing instability to the upcoming release. After final testing and approval, the release branch is merged into `main` and tagged with the release version (e.g., `v1.2.0`). It is also merged into the `production` branch, which represents the code currently deployed in the production environment.

For example, imagine you're preparing version 2.0 of your application. You create a branch named `release/2.0` from `main`. On this branch, you might update the version number in your `package.json` file and fix a last-minute bug discovered during testing. These changes are then merged back into `main` to keep it up-to-date. Finally, `release/2.0` is merged into both `main` and `production`, and a tag `v2.0` is created to mark the release point.
