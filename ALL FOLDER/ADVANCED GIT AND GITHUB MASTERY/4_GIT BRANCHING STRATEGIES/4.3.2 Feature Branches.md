Feature branches are a cornerstone of the GitHub Flow, allowing developers to isolate new features or bug fixes from the main codebase (typically `main` or `master`). This isolation prevents unstable or incomplete code from directly impacting the production environment or other developers' work. Each feature, bug fix, or experiment gets its own dedicated branch, branching off from the latest stable version of the main branch. This promotes parallel development and reduces the risk of introducing regressions.

The workflow is straightforward: create a new branch named descriptively (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication` or `bugfix/resolve-login-error`), commit your changes to this branch, and then, when ready, open a pull request to merge the feature branch back into the main branch. This pull request serves as a request for code review and discussion before integration.

For example, if you're adding a new search functionality, you'd create a branch like `feature/search-functionality`. All your search-related code goes into this branch. Similarly, if you're fixing a bug where users can't reset their passwords, you'd create a branch like `bugfix/password-reset`. This keeps your work organized and allows for focused testing and review.
