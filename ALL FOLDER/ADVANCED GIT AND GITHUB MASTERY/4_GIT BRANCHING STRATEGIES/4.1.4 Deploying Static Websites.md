GitHub Pages provides a simple and free way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. This is incredibly useful for showcasing personal projects, creating documentation sites, or building simple landing pages. You can deploy websites built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or leverage static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby. The process typically involves pushing your website's files to a specific branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`) or a dedicated folder within your repository.

GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys your site, making it accessible via a GitHub-provided URL (e.g., `your-username.github.io/your-repository`) or a custom domain you configure. For example, if you have a simple HTML file named `index.html` in the root of your `main` branch, GitHub Pages will serve that file when someone visits your site. Another common example is using Jekyll. If you have a Jekyll project in your repository, GitHub Pages will automatically run Jekyll to generate the static site before deploying it.

To get started, navigate to your repository's settings on GitHub, find the "Pages" section, and configure the source branch and folder for your website. GitHub will then provide you with the URL where your site is hosted. This streamlined deployment process makes GitHub Pages an invaluable tool for developers looking to quickly and easily share their work with the world.
