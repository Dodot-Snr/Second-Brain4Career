The "Single Master Branch" strategy, often considered the simplest form of GitHub Flow, revolves around maintaining a single, perpetually deployable `master` (or `main`) branch. All changes, regardless of size or complexity, are integrated into this branch through short-lived feature branches and pull requests. This approach emphasizes continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), ensuring that the `master` branch always reflects the latest stable version of the codebase.

The core principle is that every commit to `master` should be deployable. This necessitates rigorous testing and code review processes for all pull requests before they are merged. For example, a developer working on a new user authentication feature would create a branch like `feature/user-auth`, implement the changes, write tests, and then submit a pull request to merge into `master`. Once the pull request passes code review and automated tests, it's merged, and the changes are immediately deployed to production (or a staging environment for final verification).

This model works best for smaller teams and projects with frequent deployments. It simplifies the branching strategy and reduces the overhead associated with managing multiple long-lived branches. However, it requires a strong commitment to automated testing and a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure the stability of the `master` branch.
