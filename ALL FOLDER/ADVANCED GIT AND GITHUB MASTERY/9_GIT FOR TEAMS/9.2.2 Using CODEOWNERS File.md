The `CODEOWNERS` file is a powerful mechanism in Git repositories, particularly on platforms like GitHub and GitLab, for defining individuals or teams responsible for specific files or directories within the project. This file lives in the root of the repository, or in the `.github/`, `.gitlab/`, or `docs/` directories, and its primary purpose is to automatically request reviews from the designated owners when pull requests modify their areas of responsibility. This ensures that changes are reviewed by those with the most relevant expertise, improving code quality and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

The `CODEOWNERS` file uses a simple syntax. Each line specifies a file pattern followed by one or more GitHub usernames, team names (using the `@org/team-name` format), or email addresses. For example, `*.js @octocat` would assign code ownership of all JavaScript files to the user `@octocat`. Similarly, `docs/ @docs-team` would assign ownership of the `docs/` directory to the `@docs-team` team. When a pull request modifies files matching these patterns, the specified owners are automatically added as reviewers.

Here's a practical example:

```
# Assign ownership of all Python files to the core team
*.py @core-team

# Assign ownership of the API documentation to Jane Doe
docs/api/ jane.doe@example.com

# Ignore changes to vendor directory
/vendor/ @nobody
```

In this example, any changes to Python files will automatically request a review from the `@core-team` team. Changes to the `docs/api/` directory will request a review from `jane.doe@example.com`. Finally, changes to the `/vendor/` directory will not request any reviews, as `@nobody` is a placeholder. This allows for fine-grained control over code ownership and review processes.
