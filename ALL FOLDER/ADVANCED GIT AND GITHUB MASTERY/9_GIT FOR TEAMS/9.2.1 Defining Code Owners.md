Code ownership is a crucial aspect of collaborative software development, ensuring accountability and expertise for specific parts of a codebase. Defining code owners in Git and GitHub allows you to automatically assign reviewers to pull requests based on the files being modified. This streamlines the review process, ensures knowledgeable individuals are involved, and promotes consistent code quality.

GitHub uses a `CODEOWNERS` file to define these ownership rules. This file, typically located in the repository's root, `.github/`, or `docs/` directory, maps file paths or patterns to one or more GitHub usernames or team names. When a pull request modifies files matching a pattern in the `CODEOWNERS` file, the specified owners are automatically requested for review. For example, a line like `docs/ @octocat` would assign the user `@octocat` as the owner for any changes within the `docs/` directory. Similarly, `*.js @frontend-team` would assign the `@frontend-team` to all JavaScript files.

By leveraging the `CODEOWNERS` file, teams can establish clear responsibility for different modules, components, or even specific files. This not only improves the efficiency of code reviews but also fosters a sense of ownership and encourages developers to become experts in their assigned areas.
