Onboarding new team members effectively requires providing comprehensive training on Git and GitHub best practices. This training should go beyond basic commands and delve into the advanced workflows and collaborative strategies that your team utilizes. The goal is to equip new members with the knowledge and skills to contribute confidently and efficiently to the team's projects, while also adhering to established standards.

A crucial aspect of this training is demonstrating your team's branching strategy. For example, explain the purpose of feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches, and how they interact within your team's workflow. Walk through a practical scenario, such as creating a new feature branch, making changes, submitting a pull request, and merging the changes after review. Another key example is demonstrating how to effectively use Git hooks to automate tasks like code linting or running tests before commits, ensuring code quality and consistency across the team.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "Running linters..."
# Add your linting commands here
echo "Running tests..."
# Add your test commands here
```
