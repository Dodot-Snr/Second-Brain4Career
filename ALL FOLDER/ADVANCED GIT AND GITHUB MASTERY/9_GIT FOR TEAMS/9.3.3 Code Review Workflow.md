Code review is a critical practice in collaborative software development, ensuring code quality, knowledge sharing, and bug prevention. It involves having other developers examine proposed changes before they are merged into the main codebase. This process helps identify potential issues, enforce coding standards, and improve the overall maintainability of the project. A well-defined code review workflow streamlines this process, making it efficient and effective.

A typical code review workflow involves a developer creating a pull request (PR) on GitHub. The PR contains the proposed changes and triggers notifications to designated reviewers. Reviewers then examine the code, providing feedback directly on the PR, suggesting changes, and asking clarifying questions. The original developer addresses the feedback, pushing updated code to the PR, which automatically updates the review. This iterative process continues until the reviewers are satisfied, at which point the PR is approved and merged.

For example, imagine a developer submits a PR with a new feature. A reviewer might notice a potential security vulnerability in the code:

```python
def process_input(user_input):
  # Vulnerable code: directly executing user input
  eval(user_input)
```

The reviewer would comment on the PR, highlighting the vulnerability and suggesting a safer alternative, such as using a predefined set of allowed commands or input validation. This collaborative feedback loop ensures that the code is secure and robust before being integrated into the project.
