The Feature Branch Workflow is a core collaboration strategy in Git, revolving around isolating new development work within dedicated branches. Instead of directly committing to the `main` (or `master`) branch, developers create a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or experiment. This isolation prevents unstable or incomplete code from impacting the main codebase and allows for focused development and easier code review.

This workflow promotes parallel development, as multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other. Once a feature is complete and thoroughly tested, a pull request is created to merge the feature branch back into the `main` branch. This pull request triggers a code review process, ensuring code quality and adherence to project standards.

For example, imagine a team working on a website. One developer might create a branch called `feature/add-shopping-cart` to implement the shopping cart functionality, while another creates `feature/redesign-homepage` to update the homepage design. Each developer works independently on their branch, and once their feature is ready, they submit a pull request to merge it into the `main` branch. This keeps the `main` branch stable and allows for controlled integration of new features.
