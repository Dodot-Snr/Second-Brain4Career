This section focuses on equipping new team members with the essential tools and configurations needed to effectively collaborate using Git and GitHub. A smooth setup process is crucial for a positive onboarding experience and ensures everyone can contribute to the codebase from day one. We'll cover installing Git, configuring user settings, generating SSH keys for secure authentication, and connecting to the team's GitHub repositories.

A key step is configuring Git with the correct user information. This ensures proper attribution for commits. For example, after installing Git, you'll want to run the following commands, replacing the example values with your own:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Another critical aspect is setting up SSH keys. Using SSH keys allows you to authenticate with GitHub without having to enter your username and password every time. This enhances security and streamlines the development workflow. The process involves generating a new SSH key pair, adding the public key to your GitHub account, and configuring your local Git environment to use the SSH key.
