Enforcing code ownership is crucial for maintaining code quality, ensuring accountability, and streamlining the review process within a collaborative software development environment. While Git and GitHub don't inherently _enforce_ ownership in a technical sense, they provide powerful mechanisms and workflows that, when implemented strategically, can effectively establish and maintain clear ownership boundaries. This involves leveraging features like CODEOWNERS files, branch protections, and pull request assignments to designate individuals or teams responsible for specific parts of the codebase.

A primary method for enforcing code ownership is the `CODEOWNERS` file. This file, placed in the root of your repository (or in the `.github` directory), maps file paths or patterns to specific users or teams. When a pull request modifies files covered by a `CODEOWNERS` entry, the designated owners are automatically requested for review. For example, a line like `docs/* @octocat` in the `CODEOWNERS` file would automatically request a review from the `@octocat` user for any changes made to files within the `docs` directory. Another example is using branch protection rules to require code review from specific teams before merging into protected branches like `main` or `develop`. This ensures that changes to critical parts of the codebase are always reviewed by the appropriate owners.
