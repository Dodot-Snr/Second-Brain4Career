A crucial part of onboarding new team members is clearly outlining the team's Git workflow. This ensures everyone understands how code changes are proposed, reviewed, and integrated into the main codebase. A well-defined workflow minimizes conflicts, promotes code quality, and streamlines the development process. This explanation should cover branching strategies, pull request procedures, and any specific tools or conventions used by the team.

For example, you might explain a Gitflow workflow, where `develop` is the main integration branch and feature branches are created for individual tasks. New team members need to understand how to create feature branches, commit changes, and then create a pull request targeting the `develop` branch. Another common example is a simplified GitHub flow, where developers branch directly from `main` (or `master`) for each feature, and pull requests are used for all changes, even small ones. It's also important to explain how code reviews are conducted and what criteria are used to approve a pull request.

```
# Example: Creating a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Example: Creating a pull request
# (After pushing the feature branch to the remote repository)
# Go to GitHub, navigate to the repository, and click "New pull request"
```
