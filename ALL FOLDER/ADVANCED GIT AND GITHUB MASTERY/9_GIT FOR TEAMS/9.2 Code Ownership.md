Code ownership is a practice where specific individuals or teams are designated as responsible for maintaining and evolving particular parts of a codebase. This doesn't mean others can't contribute, but it establishes clear accountability and expertise. Owners are typically the go-to people for understanding the intricacies of their code, reviewing changes, and ensuring its quality. This approach fosters a sense of responsibility and encourages deeper understanding of specific areas within a project.

A common example is assigning ownership of specific modules or microservices to different teams. The "Authentication Team" might own the `auth/` directory containing all authentication-related code, while the "Payment Team" owns the `payment/` directory. Another example within a single repository could be assigning ownership of the UI components to the "Frontend Team" and the API endpoints to the "Backend Team." This allows for focused expertise and efficient maintenance.

Effective code ownership leads to better code quality, faster bug fixes, and improved knowledge sharing. When someone needs to make a change or understand a particular piece of code, they know exactly who to consult. This reduces ambiguity and promotes collaboration, ultimately contributing to a more maintainable and robust codebase.
