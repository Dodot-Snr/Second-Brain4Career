Large Git repositories can significantly impact performance, leading to slow clone times, increased storage costs, and sluggish Git operations. Optimizing repository size is crucial for maintaining a healthy and efficient development workflow. This involves identifying and removing unnecessary large files, rewriting history to eliminate unwanted data, and configuring Git to ignore specific patterns.

Common culprits for bloated repositories include large binary files (images, videos, executables), build artifacts, and accidentally committed sensitive data. Tools like `git lfs` can help manage large files by storing them outside the repository while keeping pointers within Git. Techniques like `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` (a more modern and recommended alternative) can be used to rewrite history and remove unwanted files or sensitive information. For example, you might use `git filter-repo --blob-callback 'if blob.data.startswith(b"password="): print("Removing password!"); blob.data = b""'` to remove blobs containing passwords.

Ignoring unnecessary files from the start using a `.gitignore` file is a preventative measure that can save significant effort later. For instance, adding `*.log` or `/build/` to your `.gitignore` will prevent log files and build artifacts from being tracked, keeping your repository lean and focused on essential source code.
