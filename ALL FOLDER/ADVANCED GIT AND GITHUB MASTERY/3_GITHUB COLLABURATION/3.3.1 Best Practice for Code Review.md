Code review is a critical step in the software development lifecycle, ensuring code quality, knowledge sharing, and bug prevention. Effective code reviews go beyond simply identifying errors; they foster a collaborative environment where developers learn from each other and contribute to a more robust and maintainable codebase. This section outlines best practices for conducting thorough and constructive code reviews.

A key aspect of effective code review is focusing on both the "what" and the "how." The "what" involves verifying that the code fulfills the intended functionality and aligns with the project's requirements. The "how" focuses on code style, readability, and maintainability. For example, instead of just saying "This code doesn't work," a better approach is to say, "This code doesn't handle the edge case where the input is negative. Consider adding a check for `if (input < 0)` and returning an error message." This provides specific guidance and helps the author understand the issue and how to resolve it.

Another crucial practice is to provide constructive and actionable feedback. Avoid vague or accusatory comments. Instead, offer specific suggestions for improvement and explain the reasoning behind them. For instance, instead of saying "This code is messy," try "This function is quite long and complex. Could we break it down into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and testability? Perhaps we could extract the logic for calculating the average into a separate function called `calculate_average()`." This approach promotes a positive learning experience and encourages the author to improve their coding skills.
