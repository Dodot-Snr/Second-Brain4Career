Squashing and merging is a powerful technique used during pull requests to create a cleaner, more linear project history. Instead of merging every commit from a feature branch individually, squashing combines all the commits into a single commit on the target branch (usually `main` or `develop`). This results in a simplified history, making it easier to understand the evolution of the codebase and revert changes if necessary. The original commits from the feature branch remain in the branch's history, unless the branch is deleted.

Consider a scenario where you're working on a new feature and make several commits like "Fix typo," "Add logging," and "Refactor code." When creating a pull request, these individual commits might not be valuable to keep in the main branch's history. Squashing allows you to combine them into a single, more descriptive commit like "Implement user authentication feature." This provides a clear and concise record of the feature's introduction without cluttering the history with minor implementation details.

GitHub provides a convenient "Squash and merge" option directly within the pull request interface. Alternatively, you can perform squashing locally using Git commands like `git rebase -i HEAD~n` (where `n` is the number of commits to squash) and then force-push the squashed branch to the remote repository. For example, if you have 3 commits to squash, you would use `git rebase -i HEAD~3`. This will open an editor where you can choose which commits to "pick" (keep) and which to "squash" (merge into the previous commit).
