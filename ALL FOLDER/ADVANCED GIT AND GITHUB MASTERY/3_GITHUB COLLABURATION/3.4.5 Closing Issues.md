Closing issues is a fundamental part of issue management on GitHub. It signifies that the problem or feature request described in the issue has been resolved or addressed. A closed issue remains visible and searchable, providing a valuable record of past work and decisions. Properly closing issues helps maintain a clean and organized repository, making it easier to track ongoing and future development efforts.

There are several ways to close an issue. The most common is by directly closing it from the issue page itself, using the "Close issue" button. However, a powerful feature of GitHub is the ability to automatically close issues by mentioning them in a commit message. For example, including "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456" in a commit message that is then pushed to the repository will automatically close issues #123 and #456, respectively, when the commit is merged into the default branch. This creates a direct link between the code that resolved the issue and the issue itself, improving traceability and context.

For example, if you have an issue numbered #789 describing a bug, and you fix that bug with a commit, your commit message could be: `Fix: Resolved issue with incorrect date formatting. Closes #789`. When this commit is merged, issue #789 will automatically be closed. You can also use keywords like `resolved`, `fixed`, or `addresses` followed by the issue number to achieve the same result.
