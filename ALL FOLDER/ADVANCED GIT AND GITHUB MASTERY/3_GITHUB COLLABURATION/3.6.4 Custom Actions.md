Custom Actions in GitHub Actions allow you to create reusable components that encapsulate complex workflows or specific tasks. These actions can be shared within your repository, across your organization, or even publicly on the GitHub Marketplace. By creating custom actions, you can significantly reduce code duplication, improve workflow maintainability, and promote consistency across your projects. They are essentially building blocks that you can combine to create more complex and powerful CI/CD pipelines.

There are three main types of custom actions: Docker container actions, JavaScript actions, and composite run steps actions. Docker container actions package your code and dependencies into a Docker image, ensuring consistent execution environments. JavaScript actions run directly on the runner machine using Node.js. Composite run steps actions allow you to combine multiple shell commands into a single reusable action.

For example, you might create a custom action to automatically lint and format your code using a specific set of tools. Another example could be an action that deploys your application to a specific environment after successful tests. By encapsulating these tasks into custom actions, you can easily reuse them across multiple workflows and projects, saving time and effort.
