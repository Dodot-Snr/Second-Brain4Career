Kanban boards are a powerful visual tool for managing and tracking projects within GitHub Projects. They provide a clear overview of the workflow, allowing teams to visualize the progress of tasks, identify bottlenecks, and collaborate more effectively. Each column on the board represents a stage in the workflow (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," "Done"), and individual tasks or issues are represented as cards that move across the board as they progress. This visual representation makes it easy to understand the current state of the project and identify areas that need attention.

GitHub Projects offers a flexible and integrated Kanban board experience. You can easily create new boards, customize columns to match your team's workflow, and add issues directly from your repositories. For example, you might create a board for a software development project with columns like "Backlog," "Development," "Testing," and "Deployed." As developers work on features, they move the corresponding issue cards through these columns, providing a real-time view of the development process. Furthermore, you can automate certain actions, such as automatically moving an issue to the "Done" column when a pull request is merged. This automation streamlines the workflow and reduces manual effort.
