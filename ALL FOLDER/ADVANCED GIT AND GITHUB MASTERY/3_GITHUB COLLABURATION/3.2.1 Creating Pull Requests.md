Creating pull requests (PRs) is a fundamental aspect of collaborative software development using Git and GitHub. A pull request is essentially a request to merge changes from one branch (typically a feature branch) into another (usually the main or develop branch). It provides a structured way to review code, discuss potential issues, and ensure code quality before integration. The process involves pushing your local branch to a remote repository, then initiating a pull request through the GitHub interface.

The pull request acts as a central hub for discussion and review. Team members can examine the proposed changes, leave comments on specific lines of code, suggest modifications, and even run automated tests to verify the code's functionality and adherence to coding standards. For example, imagine you've implemented a new user authentication feature on a branch called `feature/user-auth`. You would create a pull request targeting the `develop` branch to propose merging your changes.

A well-crafted pull request includes a clear title, a detailed description of the changes, and references to any relevant issues or user stories. This context helps reviewers understand the purpose and scope of the changes, facilitating a more efficient and effective review process. For instance, your PR description might state: "Implements user authentication using JWT. Fixes issue #123 and addresses user story #456."
