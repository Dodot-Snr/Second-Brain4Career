GitHub provides a robust suite of features designed to facilitate effective code reviews. These features go beyond simply viewing code changes; they enable structured discussions, automated checks, and clear tracking of feedback. Understanding and utilizing these tools is crucial for maintaining code quality and fostering collaboration within a development team. Key aspects include creating pull requests, adding reviewers, leaving comments directly on specific lines of code, and using features like "suggested changes" to propose concrete improvements.

A common workflow involves a developer creating a pull request (PR) targeting the `main` branch. They then request reviews from relevant team members. Reviewers can then add comments directly to the code within the PR, highlighting potential issues or suggesting improvements. For example, a reviewer might comment on a function's complexity, suggesting it be refactored into smaller, more manageable units. They could even use the "suggested changes" feature to provide the refactored code directly:

```python
# Original code
def process_data(data):
    # Complex data processing logic here...
    # ... multiple nested loops and conditional statements ...
    return result

# Suggested change (via GitHub's suggested changes feature)
def process_data(data):
    processed_data = clean_data(data)
    transformed_data = transform_data(processed_data)
    return aggregate_data(transformed_data)

def clean_data(data):
    # Cleaning logic
    pass

def transform_data(data):
    # Transformation logic
    pass

def aggregate_data(data):
    # Aggregation logic
    pass
```

GitHub also allows for automated code review through integrations with linters and static analysis tools. These tools can automatically flag potential issues, such as style violations or security vulnerabilities, directly within the pull request, further streamlining the review process and ensuring consistent code quality.
