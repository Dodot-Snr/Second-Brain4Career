Workflows are the heart of GitHub Actions, defining automated processes that run in response to specific events within your repository. These events can range from code pushes and pull requests to scheduled tasks and manual triggers. A workflow is essentially a YAML file that lives in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository, outlining a series of jobs to be executed. Each job consists of one or more steps, which can be individual commands, shell scripts, or pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace or custom-built actions.

Creating a workflow involves defining the trigger event, specifying the environment in which the job will run (e.g., a specific operating system), and outlining the sequence of steps to be performed. For example, you might create a workflow that automatically runs unit tests whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch. Another common example is a workflow that builds and deploys your application to a staging environment upon merging a pull request.

Here's a simple example of a workflow that runs on every push to the `main` branch:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo "Hello, world!"
```
