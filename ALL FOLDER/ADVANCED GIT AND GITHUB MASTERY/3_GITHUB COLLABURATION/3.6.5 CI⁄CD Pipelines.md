CI/CD pipelines are the backbone of modern software development, automating the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. CI stands for Continuous Integration, which focuses on frequently merging code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests. CD stands for Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment, extending CI by automating the release process, either to a staging environment for manual verification (Continuous Delivery) or directly to production (Continuous Deployment).

Within GitHub Actions, you define CI/CD pipelines using YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. These workflows specify a series of jobs, each containing one or more steps that execute commands or use pre-built actions. For example, you might have a job that builds your application, followed by a job that runs unit tests, and finally a job that deploys the application to a server.

A common example is a pipeline that triggers on every push to the `main` branch. This pipeline might first build a Docker image of your application:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build the Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-app .
```

Then, after successful build, it could push the image to a container registry and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. This automation ensures that code changes are rapidly and reliably integrated, tested, and deployed, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of errors.
