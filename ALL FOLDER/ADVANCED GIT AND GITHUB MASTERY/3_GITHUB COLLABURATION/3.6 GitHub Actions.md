GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform directly integrated into your GitHub repositories. It allows you to automate tasks within your software development workflow, such as building, testing, and deploying code. Actions are triggered by events in your repository, like pushes, pull requests, or scheduled cron jobs. This enables you to create custom workflows that streamline your development process and improve code quality.

Workflows are defined using YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. These files specify the events that trigger the workflow, the jobs to be executed, and the steps within each job. Each step can run a command-line script, execute a pre-built action from the GitHub Marketplace, or even run a Docker container. This flexibility makes GitHub Actions suitable for a wide range of automation tasks.

For example, you could create a workflow that automatically runs unit tests whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch. Another common use case is automating deployments to a staging or production environment after a pull request is merged. Here's a simple example of a workflow that runs on every push:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!
```
