Server-side hooks reside on the remote Git server and are triggered by Git actions performed by users pushing to the repository. Unlike client-side hooks, server-side hooks are more powerful as they can enforce repository policies and maintain code quality across the entire team. They are typically used for tasks like preventing commits with bad commit messages, running automated tests before accepting changes, or deploying code to a production environment. Because they run on the server, they can be used to reject pushes that don't meet certain criteria, ensuring a consistent and reliable codebase.

A common example is the `pre-receive` hook, which runs before any references are updated. This hook can be used to validate commit messages against a specific format, ensuring that all commits adhere to the team's standards. Another powerful example is the `post-receive` hook, which runs after references have been updated. This hook is often used to trigger deployment scripts, automatically deploying the latest changes to a staging or production server. For instance, you could use it to update a website's files after a successful push to the `main` branch.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
while read oldrev newrev refname
do
  if [[ $refname = refs/heads/main ]]; then
    echo "Deploying to production..."
    # Your deployment script here
  fi
done
```

This simple `post-receive` hook snippet demonstrates how to trigger a deployment script whenever a push is made to the `main` branch. Server-side hooks are essential for maintaining a robust and well-managed Git repository.
