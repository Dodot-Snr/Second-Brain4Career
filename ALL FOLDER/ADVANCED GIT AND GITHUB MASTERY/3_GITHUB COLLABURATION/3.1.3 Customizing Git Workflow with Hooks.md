Git hooks are powerful scripts that Git executes automatically before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They allow you to customize your Git workflow and enforce specific policies within your repository. By leveraging hooks, you can automate tasks like code linting, running tests, and enforcing commit message standards, ensuring higher code quality and consistency across your team. They reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository.

Hooks are categorized as client-side (triggered on the developer's machine) and server-side (triggered on the Git server). A common client-side hook is `pre-commit`, which can be used to run linters or formatters before a commit is created. A server-side hook like `pre-receive` can be used to reject pushes that don't meet certain criteria, such as failing tests or containing invalid commit messages.

For example, you could create a `pre-commit` hook that runs a Python linter like `flake8` on your staged changes:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
flake8 --diff --exit-zero
```

This script, when placed in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and made executable (`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`), will run `flake8` on the staged changes before each commit. If `flake8` finds any errors, it will prevent the commit from proceeding. Similarly, a `commit-msg` hook can be used to validate the format of commit messages.
