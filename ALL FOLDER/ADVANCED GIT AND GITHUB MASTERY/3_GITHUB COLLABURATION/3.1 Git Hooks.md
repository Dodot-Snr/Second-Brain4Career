Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are a powerful way to customize Git's internal behavior and automate tasks within your development workflow. Hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory of your Git repository and are typically shell scripts, but can be written in any scripting language.

These hooks can be used for a variety of purposes, including enforcing commit message standards, running tests before allowing a commit, or deploying code automatically after a successful push. By leveraging Git hooks, you can ensure code quality, maintain consistency across your team, and streamline your development process.

For example, a `pre-commit` hook could be used to run linters and formatters on staged files, preventing commits with style errors. Another common use case is a `pre-push` hook that runs unit tests to ensure that only working code is pushed to a remote repository. Here's an example of a simple `pre-commit` hook written in bash that checks for the presence of a ticket number in the commit message:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
commit_msg=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)

if ! echo "$commit_msg" | grep -q "TICKET-[0-9]\+"; then
  echo "Commit message must include a ticket number (e.g., TICKET-123)."
  exit 1
fi
```
