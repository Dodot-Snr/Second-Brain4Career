Client-side hooks are scripts that run locally on your machine before or after certain Git events. They allow you to automate and customize your development workflow by enforcing coding standards, preventing commits with errors, or enhancing your commit messages. Unlike server-side hooks, client-side hooks are not shared across a repository and are specific to each user's local environment. They reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository.

These hooks can be used for a variety of tasks. For example, a `pre-commit` hook can run linters or formatters to ensure code quality before a commit is made. Another common use case is a `commit-msg` hook that validates the commit message format, ensuring it adheres to a specific style guide. Because they are local, client-side hooks are ideal for personal workflow enhancements and pre-emptive error checking.

A simple example of a `pre-commit` hook written in bash that prevents commits with the word "TODO" would look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -q '\.java$'; then
  if git diff --cached | grep -q "TODO"; then
    echo "Error: Commit contains 'TODO' comments. Please remove them before committing."
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

This script checks if any staged Java files contain the word "TODO" and prevents the commit if found.
