Reviewing pull requests is a crucial step in collaborative software development. It ensures code quality, identifies potential bugs, and promotes knowledge sharing within the team. A thorough review involves examining the code changes, understanding the purpose of the pull request, and providing constructive feedback to the author. This process helps maintain a consistent coding style, improves the overall codebase, and prevents integration issues.

Effective pull request reviews go beyond simply checking for syntax errors. They involve understanding the logic behind the changes, considering potential edge cases, and evaluating the impact on existing functionality. For example, if a pull request introduces a new feature, the reviewer should verify that it aligns with the project's goals and doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities. Similarly, if a pull request refactors existing code, the reviewer should ensure that the changes don't break any existing tests and that the refactoring improves readability and maintainability.

Consider a scenario where a pull request adds a new function to calculate the area of a circle. A reviewer should not only check if the formula is correct (πr²) but also consider edge cases like negative radius values. A good review might suggest adding input validation to handle such cases:

```python
def calculate_circle_area(radius):
  """Calculates the area of a circle.

  Args:
    radius: The radius of the circle.

  Returns:
    The area of the circle, or None if the radius is invalid.
  """
  if radius < 0:
    return None  # Invalid radius
  return 3.14159 * radius * radius
```

By providing such feedback, the reviewer helps improve the quality and robustness of the code.
