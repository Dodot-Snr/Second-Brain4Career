Pull Requests (PRs) are the cornerstone of collaborative development on platforms like GitHub. They represent a formal request to merge changes from one branch (typically a feature branch) into another (usually the main or develop branch). A PR isn't just about merging code; it's a mechanism for code review, discussion, and ensuring code quality before integration. The process involves opening a PR, having team members review the proposed changes, addressing feedback, and finally, merging the code.

Think of a scenario where you're adding a new feature to a website. You create a branch called `feature/new-login`. After implementing the feature, you open a PR targeting the `develop` branch. Your team reviews the code, suggests improvements like better error handling or code style adjustments. You address these comments by pushing new commits to your `feature/new-login` branch, which automatically updates the PR. Once everyone is satisfied, the PR is approved and merged into `develop`.

Another common example is fixing a bug. You might create a branch `bugfix/issue-123` to address a specific problem. After fixing the bug, you open a PR targeting the `main` branch (or a release branch). The review process ensures the fix is correct and doesn't introduce new issues. This collaborative approach helps maintain a stable and reliable codebase.
