GitHub Packages is a package hosting service, integrated directly with GitHub, that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly alongside your code. It supports various package managers, including npm (JavaScript), Maven (Java), NuGet (.NET), RubyGems (Ruby), Docker, and more. This integration simplifies your workflow by allowing you to manage your code and packages in one place, using the same access controls and authentication methods.

Using GitHub Packages, you can publish packages associated with a specific repository or organization. This makes it easy to share libraries, tools, and applications within your team or with the open-source community. You can control who has access to your packages, ensuring that sensitive code remains private while allowing public packages to be easily discoverable and used by others.

For example, you might publish a custom React component library to GitHub Packages using npm. The package would be associated with your GitHub repository, and developers could install it using `npm install @your-org/my-react-components --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`. Similarly, you could host Docker images, allowing you to easily deploy your applications using images stored directly within your GitHub organization.
