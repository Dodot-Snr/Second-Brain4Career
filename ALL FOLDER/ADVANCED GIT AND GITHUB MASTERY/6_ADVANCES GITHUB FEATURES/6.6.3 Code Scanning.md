Code scanning is a powerful feature within GitHub Security that allows you to analyze the code in your repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. It uses static analysis, meaning it examines the code without actually executing it. This proactive approach helps identify potential issues early in the development lifecycle, preventing them from becoming larger problems in production. Code scanning can be configured to run automatically on every commit, pull request, or on a scheduled basis, providing continuous security monitoring.

The process involves using a variety of static analysis tools, often referred to as "scanners," to examine the codebase. These scanners look for patterns and known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection flaws, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and insecure dependencies. The results are then presented in a clear and actionable format within GitHub, allowing developers to quickly understand the identified issues and take steps to remediate them.

For example, a code scanner might identify a potential SQL injection vulnerability in a Python application where user input is directly incorporated into a database query without proper sanitization. Another example could be flagging the use of a vulnerable version of a JavaScript library with known security flaws. By identifying these issues early, code scanning helps teams build more secure and reliable software.
