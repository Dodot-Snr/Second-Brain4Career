Authentication is a critical aspect of GitHub Apps, ensuring that your app can securely access resources and act on behalf of either itself or a user. Unlike personal access tokens, GitHub Apps use a more sophisticated authentication model based on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and OAuth 2.0. This allows for fine-grained permissions and a more secure approach to accessing GitHub's API. Understanding the different authentication flows is essential for building robust and secure GitHub Apps.

There are two primary authentication methods for GitHub Apps: authenticating as the app itself and authenticating as a user on behalf of the app. Authenticating as the app uses a JWT, which is signed by GitHub and allows the app to perform actions within its granted permissions. For example, an app might use its JWT to create a new issue in a repository where it's installed. Authenticating as a user involves the OAuth 2.0 web flow, where a user grants the app permission to act on their behalf. This is useful for scenarios where the app needs to access user-specific data or perform actions that require user authorization, such as commenting on a pull request as the user.

A key example of app authentication is using the JWT to retrieve an installation access token. This token is then used to make API requests specific to a particular installation of the app. An example of user authentication is when a user clicks a "Connect with GitHub" button, which initiates the OAuth flow, ultimately granting the app permission to access their profile information.
