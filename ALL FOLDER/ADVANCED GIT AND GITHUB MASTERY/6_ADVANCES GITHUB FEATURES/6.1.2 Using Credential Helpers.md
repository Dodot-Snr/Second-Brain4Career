Credential helpers are external programs that Git uses to store and retrieve usernames and passwords (or personal access tokens) for remote repositories. They provide a more secure and convenient alternative to repeatedly entering your credentials or storing them directly in the Git configuration. Instead of Git prompting you for your credentials every time you interact with a remote repository, the credential helper securely stores them and provides them to Git when needed. This significantly streamlines your workflow and reduces the risk of accidentally exposing your credentials.

Git supports various credential helpers, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common examples include `git-credential-manager` (GCM) for Windows, macOS, and Linux, which offers secure storage and integration with system keychain services. Another example is the built-in `osxkeychain` helper on macOS, which leverages the operating system's keychain for secure storage. To configure a credential helper, you typically use the `git config` command. For instance, to use the `osxkeychain` helper, you would run:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

After configuring a credential helper, the first time you interact with a remote repository requiring authentication, you'll be prompted for your credentials. The helper will then store these credentials securely, and Git will automatically retrieve them for subsequent interactions with that repository, eliminating the need for repeated authentication. This is a crucial aspect of managing credentials effectively and securely in Git.
