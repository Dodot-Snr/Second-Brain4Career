Once you've configured a webhook in your repository, the next crucial step is setting up a system to _receive_ and process the events that GitHub sends. This typically involves creating a web server that listens for HTTP POST requests on a specific endpoint. When a webhook event is triggered (e.g., a push to the repository, a new issue being opened), GitHub will send a payload containing information about the event to this endpoint. Your server then needs to parse this payload and take appropriate action.

The process generally involves: 1) Setting up a web server (using languages like Python, Node.js, Ruby, etc.), 2) Defining a route or handler to listen for POST requests from GitHub, 3) Verifying the authenticity of the webhook (using the secret you configured), and 4) Parsing the JSON payload to extract relevant information. For example, if you're monitoring `push` events, you might extract the commit messages, author, and affected files to trigger a build process. Or, if you're monitoring `issue` events, you might extract the issue title and body to automatically add labels or assignees.

Consider a simple Node.js example using Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json({ verify: (req, res, buf) => {
  req.rawBody = buf.toString()
}}), (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-hub-signature-256'];
  const secret = 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET'; // Replace with your actual secret
  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(req.rawBody).digest('hex');
  const expectedSignature = `sha256=${hash}`;

  if (signature !== expectedSignature) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }

  const eventType = req.headers['x-github-event'];
  const payload = req.body;

  console.log(`Received ${eventType} event`);
  // Process the payload based on the event type
  console.log(payload);

  res.status(200).send('Webhook received!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Webhook server listening on port 3000'));
```

This example demonstrates how to verify the webhook signature and log the event type and payload. Remember to replace `'YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET'` with the actual secret you configured in your GitHub webhook settings.
