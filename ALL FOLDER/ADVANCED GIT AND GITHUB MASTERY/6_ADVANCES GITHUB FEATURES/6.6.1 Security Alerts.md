GitHub security alerts proactively notify you about vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. These alerts are triggered when GitHub detects a known security vulnerability in a dependency listed in your repository's manifest file (e.g., `package.json`, `Gemfile`, `requirements.txt`). This allows you to quickly identify and address potential security risks before they can be exploited. The alerts provide information about the vulnerability, the affected dependency, and recommended actions to remediate the issue, such as updating to a patched version.

Security alerts are powered by the GitHub Advisory Database, a curated collection of known vulnerabilities. When a vulnerability is identified, GitHub scans public repositories for affected dependencies. If a match is found, a security alert is generated and displayed in the repository's "Security" tab. You can configure how you receive these alerts, such as via email or web notifications. For example, if your `package.json` file lists an outdated version of `lodash` with a known prototype pollution vulnerability, GitHub will generate an alert prompting you to update to a secure version.

Beyond simply alerting you, GitHub also offers Dependabot security updates, which can automatically create pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies to patched versions. This streamlines the remediation process and helps you keep your project secure with minimal effort. For instance, if a security alert is triggered for a vulnerable version of a Python package in your `requirements.txt` file, Dependabot can automatically create a pull request that updates the package to the latest secure version, including the necessary changes to your project.
