GitHub Apps are a powerful way to automate and extend your workflow on GitHub. Unlike OAuth Apps, GitHub Apps act on their own behalf, using their own identity, rather than impersonating a user. This allows for more granular permissions and improved security. They can respond to webhooks, access the REST and GraphQL APIs, and perform actions based on events happening in your repositories or organizations. This makes them ideal for building integrations that automate tasks, enforce policies, and enhance collaboration.

GitHub Apps are installed directly on organizations or individual repositories, giving you fine-grained control over the resources they can access. They use a permission model based on specific events and data, allowing you to grant only the necessary access. For example, you could create a GitHub App that automatically labels new issues based on their content or a CI/CD pipeline that triggers builds and deployments upon code pushes.

A key example is a static analysis tool that automatically reviews pull requests and provides feedback on code quality. Another example is a bot that automatically closes stale issues after a period of inactivity. These apps can significantly improve efficiency and maintain code quality across your projects.
