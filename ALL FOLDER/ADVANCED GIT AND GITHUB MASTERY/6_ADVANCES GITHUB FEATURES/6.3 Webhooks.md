Webhooks are automated HTTP callbacks triggered by events in a repository. Think of them as user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events, such as pushes, pull requests, or issues being created. Instead of constantly polling an API to check for changes, your application can register a webhook URL with GitHub, and GitHub will send an HTTP POST request to that URL whenever the specified event occurs. This allows for real-time updates and integration with other services.

Webhooks are incredibly powerful for automating workflows. For example, you could configure a webhook to trigger a continuous integration (CI) build whenever code is pushed to a repository. Another common use case is to send notifications to a chat application like Slack or Microsoft Teams when a pull request is opened or merged. This allows teams to stay informed about repository activity without having to manually check GitHub.

Here's a simple example: Imagine you have a server that needs to update its cache whenever new code is pushed to the `main` branch. You can configure a webhook on GitHub that sends a POST request to your server's endpoint (`https://your-server.com/cache-update`) whenever a push event occurs on the `main` branch. Your server then receives the request and updates its cache accordingly.
