Secret scanning is a security feature offered by GitHub that automatically detects secrets, such as API keys, tokens, and credentials, that have been accidentally committed to a repository. It helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources by identifying and alerting users to exposed secrets. This proactive approach allows developers to quickly revoke compromised credentials and prevent potential security breaches.

GitHub's secret scanning works by scanning the entire Git history of a repository, including past commits and branches. It uses pattern matching and contextual analysis to identify potential secrets. When a secret is detected, GitHub notifies the repository administrators and the user who committed the secret. The notification includes information about the type of secret detected and the location in the repository where it was found.

For example, if you accidentally commit a file containing an AWS access key ID and secret access key:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

GitHub's secret scanning would detect these credentials and alert you, allowing you to revoke the keys and prevent unauthorized access to your AWS resources. Similarly, if you commit a GitHub personal access token (PAT) by mistake, secret scanning will identify it and notify you to revoke the token.
