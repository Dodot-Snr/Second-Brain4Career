Conflicts are an inevitable part of collaborative software development using Git. They arise when multiple developers make changes to the same lines of code in the same file, and Git cannot automatically determine which changes to incorporate. Understanding how to effectively resolve these conflicts is crucial for maintaining a clean and functional codebase. This section will cover the common scenarios that lead to conflicts, the tools Git provides for identifying and resolving them, and best practices for minimizing their occurrence.

A common example is when two developers work on the same feature branch. Developer A modifies a specific function in `app.js` and commits their changes. Simultaneously, Developer B also modifies the _same_ function in `app.js` and commits their changes. When Developer B tries to push their branch, they will likely need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository first. This pull operation will result in a merge conflict because Git cannot automatically reconcile the differing changes to the function.

Another example occurs during rebasing. If you're rebasing a feature branch onto an updated `main` branch, and changes in `main` overlap with changes in your feature branch, conflicts will arise. Resolving these conflicts typically involves manually editing the affected files to choose which changes to keep, or to merge the changes in a way that preserves the intended functionality. We'll explore the tools and techniques for doing this effectively, including using visual merge tools and understanding Git's conflict markers.
