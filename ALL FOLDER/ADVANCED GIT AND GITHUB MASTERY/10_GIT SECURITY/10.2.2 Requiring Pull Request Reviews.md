Requiring pull request reviews is a crucial aspect of protecting your branches and ensuring code quality in collaborative projects. By enabling this feature in your branch protection rules, you mandate that all pull requests targeting a protected branch must receive a specified number of approvals before they can be merged. This process introduces a layer of peer review, helping to catch potential bugs, enforce coding standards, and promote knowledge sharing within the team.

GitHub offers granular control over pull request review requirements. You can specify the number of required reviewers, dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed, and even require code owner review for files they own. For example, you might require two approvals for all pull requests targeting the `main` branch and also require that any changes to the `config/database.yml` file be reviewed by the designated database administrator. This ensures critical configuration files are carefully scrutinized before being deployed.

Requiring pull request reviews not only improves code quality but also fosters a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility. It encourages team members to actively participate in the development process, learn from each other, and contribute to a more robust and maintainable codebase. This practice is especially valuable in larger projects with multiple contributors, where maintaining consistency and preventing errors is paramount.
