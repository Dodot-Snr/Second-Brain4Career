GitHub Teams provide a powerful way to manage permissions for multiple users across multiple repositories. Instead of granting individual users direct access to repositories, you can add them to a team and then grant the team the necessary permissions. This simplifies administration, especially in larger organizations, and ensures consistent access control. Teams can be granted read, write, or admin access to repositories, allowing for fine-grained control over who can view, modify, or manage the code.

Teams can also be nested within other teams, creating a hierarchical structure that mirrors your organization's structure. This allows you to easily manage permissions for entire departments or groups of developers. For example, you might have a "Frontend Developers" team with write access to all frontend-related repositories and a "Backend Developers" team with write access to backend repositories. A "Full Stack Developers" team could then include both the "Frontend Developers" and "Backend Developers" teams, inheriting their permissions.

A key example is using teams to manage access to a sensitive internal library. Instead of granting individual developers access, you create a "Security Reviewers" team and grant it read access to the library. This ensures that only authorized personnel can review the code for security vulnerabilities. Another example is using teams to manage access to a project's documentation. You could create a "Documentation Team" and grant it write access to the documentation repository, allowing them to update and maintain the documentation without granting them access to the codebase itself.
