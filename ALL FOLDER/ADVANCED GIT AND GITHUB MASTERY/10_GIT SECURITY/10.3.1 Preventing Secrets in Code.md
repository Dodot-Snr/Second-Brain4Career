One of the most critical aspects of secure coding practices, especially when using Git and GitHub, is preventing secrets from being committed to your repository. Secrets, such as API keys, passwords, database credentials, and private keys, can cause significant security breaches if exposed. Once committed, even if deleted later, these secrets can often be recovered from the Git history. Therefore, proactive measures are essential to avoid this situation.

Several strategies can be employed to prevent secrets from entering your codebase. These include using environment variables to store sensitive information outside of the code, employing pre-commit hooks to scan for potential secrets before committing, and utilizing secret scanning tools provided by GitHub and other platforms. For example, instead of hardcoding an API key directly in your Python script:

```python
# BAD PRACTICE - DO NOT DO THIS
api_key = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"

# GOOD PRACTICE - Use environment variables
import os
api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
```

By using environment variables, the API key is stored separately from the code and can be managed more securely. Another example is using `.gitignore` to prevent files containing secrets (like `.env` files) from being tracked by Git in the first place.
