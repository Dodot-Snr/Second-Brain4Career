Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are a secure alternative to using your password for authentication with Git and GitHub, especially when interacting with the GitHub API or using Git over HTTPS. They act as temporary credentials, granting specific permissions to applications or scripts without exposing your actual account password. This is crucial for automation, CI/CD pipelines, and any scenario where you need to authenticate programmatically. PATs offer granular control, allowing you to define the exact scope of access (e.g., read-only access to repositories, write access to issues, etc.), minimizing the potential damage if a token is compromised.

To create a PAT, navigate to your GitHub settings, then Developer settings, and finally Personal access tokens. You'll be prompted to give the token a descriptive name, set an expiration date, and select the scopes it should have. For example, if you're writing a script to automatically create issues in a repository, you'd need to grant the `repo:status` and `issues:write` scopes. Once created, treat the token like a password â€“ store it securely and avoid committing it to your repository.

Here's an example of using a PAT to clone a private repository:

```bash
git clone https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_PAT>@github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>.git
```

Another common use case is authenticating with the GitHub API using `curl`:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token <YOUR_PAT>" https://api.github.com/user
```

Remember to revoke PATs that are no longer needed to maintain good security practices.
