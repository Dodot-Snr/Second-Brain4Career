Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your GitHub account, requiring you to provide multiple verification factors when you sign in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised. Instead of just a password, you'll need something you _know_ (your password) and something you _have_ (like a code from your phone or a security key). This makes it much harder for attackers to gain access to your repositories and sensitive information.

GitHub supports several MFA methods, including authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password), SMS text messages, and security keys (like YubiKey). Authenticator apps are generally recommended as they are more secure than SMS, which can be vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks. Security keys offer the highest level of security, as they are physical devices that must be present to authenticate.

For example, after enabling MFA with an authenticator app, when you log in to GitHub, you'll enter your username and password as usual. Then, GitHub will prompt you for a code generated by your authenticator app. This code changes every 30 seconds, making it extremely difficult for an attacker to guess. Another example is using a security key. After registering your security key with GitHub, you simply insert the key into your computer's USB port and touch it when prompted during the login process.
