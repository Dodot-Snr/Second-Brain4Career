SSH keys provide a more secure and convenient way to authenticate with Git repositories, especially on platforms like GitHub. Instead of repeatedly entering your username and password, you can use a private key stored on your local machine to prove your identity to the server. This method relies on public-key cryptography, where you generate a key pair: a private key that you keep secret and a public key that you upload to your GitHub account.

The process involves generating an SSH key pair using a tool like `ssh-keygen`. You then add the public key to your GitHub account settings. When you interact with a repository using SSH, your Git client uses the private key to authenticate. For example, instead of cloning a repository using HTTPS (`https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`), you would use the SSH URL (`git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git`). This eliminates the need to enter your credentials every time you push or pull changes.

Using SSH keys not only enhances security but also streamlines your workflow. Consider a scenario where you're working on multiple projects requiring frequent Git interactions. With SSH keys, you can avoid the repetitive task of entering your password, making your development process more efficient. Furthermore, SSH keys are less susceptible to phishing attacks compared to password-based authentication, adding an extra layer of protection to your Git workflow.
