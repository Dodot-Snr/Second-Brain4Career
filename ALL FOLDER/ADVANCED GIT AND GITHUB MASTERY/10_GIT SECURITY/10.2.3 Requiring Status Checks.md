Status checks are automated tests or processes that run on your code in a repository. Requiring status checks before merging a pull request is a crucial part of protecting your branches. This ensures that all code meets certain quality standards and doesn't introduce regressions before being integrated into the protected branch. By configuring required status checks, you prevent merges until all specified checks pass, providing a safety net against broken builds or failing tests.

GitHub Actions are a common way to implement status checks. For example, you might have a GitHub Action that runs linters, unit tests, and integration tests. If any of these checks fail, the pull request cannot be merged. Another example could be a security scan that checks for vulnerabilities in your code. Only when the scan passes can the pull request be merged. This mechanism helps maintain code quality and stability in your protected branches.
