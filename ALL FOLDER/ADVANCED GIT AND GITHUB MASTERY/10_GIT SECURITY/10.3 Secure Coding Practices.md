Secure coding practices are essential for preventing vulnerabilities in your code that could be exploited by malicious actors. Integrating security considerations into your development workflow, especially when collaborating on Git and GitHub, helps ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your projects. This involves writing code that is resistant to common attacks, such as injection flaws, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows.

One key aspect of secure coding is input validation. Always sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks. For example, if your application accepts user-provided data to construct a SQL query, failing to properly escape special characters could lead to SQL injection. Another crucial practice is to avoid storing sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, directly in your codebase. Instead, utilize environment variables or secure configuration management tools.

```python
# Example of input validation to prevent SQL injection
def get_user(username):
    # Sanitize the username to prevent SQL injection
    safe_username = sanitize_input(username)
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{safe_username}'"
    # Execute the query (using a parameterized query is even better)
    # ...
```
