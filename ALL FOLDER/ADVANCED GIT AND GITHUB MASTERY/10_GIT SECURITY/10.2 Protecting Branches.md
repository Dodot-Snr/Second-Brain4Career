Branch protection is a crucial feature in Git and GitHub that allows you to enforce rules on specific branches, typically your main or develop branches. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized changes, ensuring code quality and stability. By setting up branch protection rules, you can require code reviews, status checks, and restrict who can push directly to the protected branch.

Common branch protection rules include requiring pull requests before merging, mandating a certain number of approving reviews, and enforcing status checks to pass before merging. For example, you might require that all tests pass and a senior developer approves the changes before a pull request can be merged into the `main` branch. This prevents broken code from being deployed. Another example is restricting direct pushes to the `main` branch, forcing all changes to go through the pull request process.

Branch protection is essential for collaborative projects, as it provides a safety net against accidental or malicious changes. It also promotes better code review practices and helps maintain a clean and stable codebase.
