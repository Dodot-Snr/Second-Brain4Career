Running tests is a crucial step in the Continuous Integration (CI) process. It involves automatically executing your project's test suite whenever changes are pushed to a repository. This automated testing provides immediate feedback on whether new code introduces regressions or breaks existing functionality. By integrating tests into your CI pipeline, you can catch errors early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later.

The types of tests you run can vary depending on your project, but common examples include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components or functions, while integration tests ensure that different parts of your application work together correctly. End-to-end tests simulate user interactions to validate the entire application flow. For example, a Python project might use `pytest` to run unit tests:

```python
# Example pytest test
def test_addition():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
```

By incorporating these tests into your CI workflow, you can ensure that every code change is thoroughly validated before being merged into the main branch. This leads to higher quality code, fewer bugs in production, and a more reliable software development process.
