Version control is paramount when practicing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Git is the industry-standard tool for this purpose. Storing your infrastructure definitions (e.g., Terraform configurations, Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes manifests) in Git allows you to track changes, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous states if necessary. This ensures auditability, reproducibility, and reduces the risk of configuration drift. By treating your infrastructure as code, you gain the same benefits as traditional software development, such as branching, merging, and code review.

Consider a scenario where you're using Terraform to manage your AWS infrastructure. Your Terraform configuration files, which define your EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups, should be stored in a Git repository. This allows multiple team members to work on the infrastructure simultaneously, using branches for feature development or bug fixes. Another example is using Ansible to automate server configuration. Your Ansible playbooks, which contain the steps to install software, configure services, and manage users, should also be version controlled in Git.

```terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b987928dd911d"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
```

This Terraform code, when stored in Git, becomes a trackable and auditable part of your infrastructure.
