Automating infrastructure changes is a critical component of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It moves beyond simply defining infrastructure in code to automatically applying those definitions, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and speed in deployments and updates. This automation reduces manual errors, accelerates release cycles, and enables self-service infrastructure provisioning for development teams. By leveraging Git and GitHub, we can track, review, and audit all infrastructure changes, providing a clear history and facilitating collaboration.

Tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation are commonly used to automate infrastructure changes. For example, a Terraform configuration file might define a virtual machine instance, and when changes are pushed to a Git repository, a CI/CD pipeline can automatically apply those changes to the cloud provider, creating or updating the VM. Similarly, Ansible playbooks can be used to configure software and settings on existing servers, and these playbooks can be triggered by Git events to ensure that servers are always in the desired state.

Automating infrastructure changes often involves integrating Git with CI/CD pipelines. When a pull request is merged, the pipeline can automatically run tests against the infrastructure code, validate the changes, and then apply them to a staging or production environment. This process ensures that infrastructure changes are thoroughly tested and reviewed before being deployed, minimizing the risk of errors and downtime.
