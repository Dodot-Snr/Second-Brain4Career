Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. Integrating Git with CI tools is crucial for automating this process, ensuring code quality, and accelerating the development lifecycle. By connecting your Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to a CI tool (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions), you can trigger automated workflows whenever changes are pushed, pull requests are created, or merges occur. This integration allows for immediate feedback on code changes, identifying potential issues early in the development process.

The integration typically involves configuring webhooks in your Git repository to notify the CI tool of relevant events. The CI tool then executes a predefined pipeline, which may include steps such as building the application, running unit tests, performing static code analysis, and deploying to a staging environment. For example, a GitHub Actions workflow might be triggered on every push to the `main` branch, automatically building and testing the application. Another example is using Jenkins with a Git plugin to poll a repository for changes and trigger a build when new commits are detected.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python 3.9
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```
