Automating deployments is the final, crucial step in the Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline. It involves setting up automated processes that take code changes from a repository and deploy them to a target environment (e.g., staging, production) without manual intervention. This ensures faster release cycles, reduced risk of human error, and increased efficiency. The goal is to make deployments repeatable, reliable, and predictable.

Automation is typically achieved using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI. These tools monitor the repository for changes (e.g., a merge to the main branch) and trigger a predefined workflow. This workflow might involve building the application, running tests, and then deploying the built artifacts to the target environment. Configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet can also be integrated to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration.

For example, a GitHub Actions workflow could be configured to automatically deploy a Docker container to a Kubernetes cluster whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository. Another example is using Jenkins to build a Java application, run unit and integration tests, and then deploy the resulting WAR file to a Tomcat server.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build and Push Docker Image
        # ... (Docker build and push steps) ...
      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        # ... (Kubernetes deployment steps) ...
```
