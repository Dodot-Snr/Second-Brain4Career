Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than manual configuration or interactive configuration tools. This approach allows you to treat your infrastructure like software, applying version control, testing, and automation to manage and deploy changes. IaC promotes consistency, repeatability, and reduces the risk of human error in infrastructure management. It also enables faster deployment cycles and easier rollback procedures.

By defining your infrastructure in code, you can store it in a Git repository alongside your application code. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with team members, and easily revert to previous configurations if needed. Popular IaC tools include Terraform, which uses a declarative language to define infrastructure resources across various cloud providers, and Ansible, which uses a procedural approach to configure and manage systems. For example, you might use Terraform to define a virtual machine, network, and storage account in AWS, Azure, or GCP, or use Ansible to install and configure software on a server.

```yaml
# Example Terraform configuration for an AWS EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b987928dd444a" # Replace with a valid AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "Example Instance"
  }
}
```
