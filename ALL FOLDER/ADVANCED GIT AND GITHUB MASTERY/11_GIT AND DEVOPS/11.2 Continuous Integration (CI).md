Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The primary goal of CI is to detect integration errors as quickly as possible, allowing developers to address them before they become major problems. This frequent integration and automated testing helps to reduce integration issues, improve code quality, and accelerate the development process.

CI systems typically involve a pipeline that automatically triggers when new code is pushed to the repository. This pipeline usually includes steps such as compiling the code, running unit tests, performing static analysis, and potentially deploying the application to a staging environment. For example, a CI pipeline might be configured to run all unit tests whenever a developer pushes a new commit to a feature branch. If any of the tests fail, the pipeline will report the failure, alerting the developer to the issue.

A common example is using GitHub Actions to automatically build and test a Python project. A `.github/workflows/main.yml` file could define a workflow that installs dependencies, runs linters like `flake8`, and executes unit tests using `pytest` whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch. This ensures that every commit to the main branch is automatically validated, preventing broken code from being merged.

```yaml
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install flake8 pytest
          if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: |
          flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
          flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: |
          pytest
