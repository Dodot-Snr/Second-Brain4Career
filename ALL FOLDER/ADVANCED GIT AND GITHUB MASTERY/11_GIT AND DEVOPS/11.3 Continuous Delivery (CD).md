Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice that automates the release process, enabling teams to reliably and frequently deploy software changes to production or other environments. It builds upon Continuous Integration (CI) by automating the steps required to release a build to users. This includes automated testing, environment provisioning, and deployment. The goal of CD is to ensure that code is always in a deployable state, allowing for faster feedback loops and reduced risk.

Unlike Continuous Deployment, which automatically deploys every change to production, Continuous Delivery requires explicit approval for deployment. This allows for manual quality assurance checks, security audits, or other governance processes before a release. A common example is a staging environment where changes are deployed for final testing before being promoted to production. Another example is a "blue-green deployment" strategy, where a new version of the application is deployed to a separate environment (the "blue" environment), tested, and then traffic is switched from the old environment (the "green" environment) to the new one.

CD pipelines often involve tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to orchestrate the automated steps. These pipelines can be configured to trigger deployments based on various events, such as a successful build, a merge to a specific branch, or a manual trigger. By automating the release process, CD reduces the risk of human error, improves deployment speed, and enables faster delivery of value to users.
