Git's garbage collection process identifies and removes unreachable objects, which are objects no longer referenced by any commits, tags, or branches. These objects can accumulate over time due to various operations like rewriting history (e.g., using `git rebase` or `git commit --amend`), deleting branches, or correcting mistakes. While Git automatically runs garbage collection periodically, understanding how to manually trigger and configure it can be crucial for optimizing repository size and performance, especially in large or frequently modified repositories.

Unreachable objects are initially kept around for a grace period (defaulting to two weeks) to allow for potential recovery in case of accidental deletion or history rewriting. During this period, they are considered "loose" objects. After the grace period, `git gc` can be used to pack these loose objects into packfiles and subsequently remove the truly unreachable ones. For example, if you accidentally deleted a branch containing important commits and then realized your mistake, you have two weeks to recover it using `git reflog` before those commits become eligible for garbage collection.

To force immediate removal of unreachable objects, bypassing the grace period, you can use the `--prune=now` option with `git gc`. For example, `git gc --prune=now` will aggressively remove any objects older than the current time, effectively deleting unreachable objects immediately. Be cautious when using this option, as it permanently removes objects that might still be needed for recovery purposes.
