Git, by design, isn't optimized for handling large files. Storing large binary files (like images, audio, videos, or datasets) directly in your Git repository can lead to several problems. These include increased repository size, slower cloning and fetching times, and performance issues when performing Git operations like branching and merging. This is because Git tracks every version of every file, and large files quickly bloat the repository history.

To mitigate these issues, Git Large File Storage (LFS) is used. LFS works by replacing large files in your repository with text pointers. The actual file content is stored on a separate server (like GitHub's LFS server), and Git only tracks the pointer. When you clone or checkout the repository, Git LFS automatically downloads the required large files. For example, if you have a game development project with large texture files, using LFS ensures that developers only download the textures they need, rather than the entire history of all textures. Another example is a machine learning project with large datasets; LFS allows you to version control the datasets without overwhelming your Git repository.
