Losing commits can be a stressful experience, but Git provides several mechanisms to recover them. This section focuses on techniques to restore commits that have been accidentally deleted, orphaned, or are no longer reachable through any branch or tag. Understanding how Git's internal workings, particularly the reflog and garbage collection, is crucial for successful recovery. We'll explore methods to find and resurrect these lost commits, ensuring no valuable work is permanently lost.

One common scenario is accidentally resetting a branch to an older commit using `git reset --hard`. This effectively removes all subsequent commits from the branch's history. To recover these commits, you can use `git reflog` to view a history of all changes to the branch's HEAD. The reflog will list the commit hashes of the lost commits, allowing you to create a new branch pointing to one of them, effectively bringing the lost commits back into your working history. For example, if `git reflog` shows a commit with hash `a1b2c3d`, you can run `git branch recover-branch a1b2c3d` to create a new branch named `recover-branch` pointing to that commit.

Another example involves commits that were never part of any branch, perhaps created during experimentation and then abandoned. These commits might eventually be garbage collected by Git. However, before that happens, the reflog can still be used to find them. Furthermore, even after garbage collection, there's a chance the commits might still exist in Git's object database, and tools like `git fsck --full --unreachable` can help identify and potentially recover them, although this is a more advanced and less reliable approach.
