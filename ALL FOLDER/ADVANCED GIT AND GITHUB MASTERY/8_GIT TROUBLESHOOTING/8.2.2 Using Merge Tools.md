When Git's automatic merge fails, you're left with conflict markers in your files. While you can manually edit these files to resolve the conflicts, merge tools offer a more visual and efficient way to handle complex merges. These tools present a side-by-side (or sometimes three-way) view of the conflicting files, allowing you to choose which changes to keep, edit the merged result directly, and resolve conflicts with greater clarity.

Merge tools integrate with Git and are configured to be launched when a merge conflict arises. Popular options include `meld`, `kdiff3`, `Beyond Compare`, and `Visual Studio Code's built-in merge editor`. Once configured, you can typically launch the merge tool using the command `git mergetool`. The tool will then guide you through each conflicting file, allowing you to visually compare the changes from different branches and construct the final, merged version.

For example, after encountering a merge conflict, you might run `git mergetool` and `meld` (if configured) will open. You'll see the base version, your branch's version, and the other branch's version, along with a panel to edit the merged output. After resolving the conflicts in `meld`, saving the file marks it as resolved in Git, and you can then `git add` the resolved file and `git commit` to complete the merge.
