Once you've decided to use Git LFS, the next step is configuring it for your repository. This involves specifying which file types should be tracked by LFS instead of being stored directly in Git. This is crucial because LFS only manages files you explicitly tell it to, leaving smaller text-based files to be handled by Git for optimal performance.

Configuration is done using the `git lfs track` command. This command creates (or modifies) a `.gitattributes` file in your repository, which tells Git LFS which files to manage. For example, if you want to track all `.psd` files (Adobe Photoshop files), you would run `git lfs track "*.psd"`. Similarly, to track all `.zip` archives, you'd use `git lfs track "*.zip"`. These patterns are relative to the root of your repository.

After running `git lfs track`, you need to commit the changes to the `.gitattributes` file to your repository. This ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same LFS configuration. Remember to also commit any large files you've added _after_ configuring LFS, so they are properly tracked.

```bash
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Configure LFS to track .psd and .zip files"
git add large_image.psd
git commit -m "Add large image tracked by LFS"
```
