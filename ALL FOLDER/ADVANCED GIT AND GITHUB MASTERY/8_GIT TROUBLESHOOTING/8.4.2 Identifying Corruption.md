Before you can fix a corrupted Git repository, you need to be able to identify that corruption exists. Corruption can manifest in various ways, from subtle data loss to complete repository unreadability. Common signs include Git commands failing unexpectedly, checksum errors appearing during operations like `git fsck`, or branches seemingly disappearing. Regularly running checks can help catch corruption early, minimizing potential data loss and recovery efforts.

One of the most useful tools for identifying corruption is `git fsck --full --strict`. This command performs a comprehensive check of the repository's object database, looking for inconsistencies, dangling objects, and other signs of corruption. For example, if you run `git fsck --full --strict` and see errors related to "dangling commit" or "missing commit," it indicates potential corruption. Another example is encountering errors when trying to checkout a specific commit or branch, which can point to corruption within that part of the repository's history.

```bash
git fsck --full --strict
```

Understanding the output of `git fsck` is crucial. It will list any errors it finds, often providing clues about the nature and location of the corruption. These clues are essential for choosing the appropriate repair strategy, which we'll cover in subsequent sections.
