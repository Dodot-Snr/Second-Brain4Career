The `git reflog` command is your safety net when you've made a mistake that isn't easily undone with `git reset`. It's a record of almost everything you've done in your local repository, including branch creations, commits, resets, merges, and more. Think of it as a detailed history of where your `HEAD` has been pointing. Unlike `git log`, which only shows commits reachable from the current branch, `git reflog` shows a history of all changes to the repository's references, even if those changes aren't part of any branch. This makes it invaluable for recovering lost commits or branches.

The reflog entries are assigned an index, typically starting from 0. You can use these indexes to refer to specific states of your repository. For example, if you accidentally hard reset to an older commit and want to get back to where you were, `git reflog` will show you the commit hash of the "lost" commit. You can then use `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` or `git checkout <commit-hash>` to restore your work.

For example, if you see an entry in `git reflog` like:

```
HEAD@{2}: reset: moving to HEAD@{1}
HEAD@{3}: commit: Added new feature
```

This indicates that `HEAD@{3}` represents the commit where you added a new feature. If you accidentally reset to `HEAD@{1}` and want to recover that commit, you can use `git checkout HEAD@{3}` or `git checkout <commit-hash-of-HEAD@{3}>` to return to that state. The reflog is a powerful tool, but remember that it's local to your repository and isn't pushed to remote servers.
