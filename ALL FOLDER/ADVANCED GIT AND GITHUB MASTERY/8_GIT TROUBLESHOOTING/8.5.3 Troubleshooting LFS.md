Large File Storage (LFS) can sometimes present challenges, especially when dealing with large files, collaboration, and repository management. Common issues include files not being tracked correctly, authentication problems during push/pull, and inconsistencies between local and remote LFS objects. Effective troubleshooting involves verifying LFS configuration, checking file tracking status, and ensuring proper authentication.

A frequent problem is forgetting to track a large file with LFS _before_ committing it. If you've already committed a large file directly to Git, you'll need to remove it from Git history and then add it to LFS. For example, if `my_large_video.mp4` was committed directly, you would use commands like `git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f my_large_video.mp4' HEAD` (use with caution!) followed by `git lfs track "my_large_video.mp4"` and then committing the changes. Another common issue arises from incorrect `.gitattributes` configuration. Double-check that the file patterns in `.gitattributes` accurately reflect the files you intend to track with LFS. For instance, if you want to track all `.psd` files, ensure your `.gitattributes` contains `*.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text`.
