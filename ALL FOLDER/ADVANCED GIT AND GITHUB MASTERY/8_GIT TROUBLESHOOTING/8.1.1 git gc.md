`git gc` (garbage collection) is a crucial command for maintaining a healthy and efficient Git repository. Over time, as you commit, branch, merge, and rewrite history, your repository accumulates loose objects and unnecessary data. `git gc` cleans up these loose objects, packs them into packfiles for better storage efficiency, and prunes unreachable objects, ultimately reducing the repository size and improving performance. While Git usually runs `git gc --auto` periodically, manually running `git gc` can be beneficial, especially after large-scale operations like rebasing or history rewriting.

The primary function of `git gc` is to optimize storage and improve Git's performance. It achieves this by: (1) Compressing loose objects into packfiles, which are more efficient for storage and retrieval. (2) Pruning unreachable objects, which are objects that are no longer referenced by any branch, tag, or other reachable object. (3) Optimizing packfiles by repacking them and removing redundant objects. Running `git gc` can significantly reduce the size of your `.git` directory, especially in repositories with a long history or frequent history rewrites.

For example, after a large interactive rebase where you've rewritten many commits, running `git gc` can reclaim the space occupied by the old, now-unreachable commits. A simple execution looks like this:

```bash
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

The `--prune=now` option removes all unreachable objects immediately, and `--aggressive` performs a more thorough optimization, which may take longer but can result in a smaller repository size.
