Before you can resolve a merge conflict, you need to be able to identify that one exists! Git is usually pretty good at merging changes automatically, but when changes are made to the same lines in different branches, it can't decide which version to keep. This results in a conflict, which Git flags for you to resolve manually. You'll typically encounter these conflicts during a `git merge`, `git rebase`, or `git pull` operation.

Git clearly marks conflicts within the affected files. Look for special markers like `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch-name`. The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents the changes from your current branch (HEAD), while the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch-name` shows the changes from the branch you're merging or rebasing. For example, if you and a colleague both edited the `README.md` file, you might see something like this:

```markdown
This is the README file.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This line was changed in my branch.
=======
This line was changed in the feature branch.
>>>>>>> feature/new-feature

This is the end of the README file.
```

Git also provides status updates in the terminal. After a failed merge, `git status` will list the files with conflicts, allowing you to quickly pinpoint where your attention is needed. This output will clearly state "Unmerged paths" and list the conflicting files.
