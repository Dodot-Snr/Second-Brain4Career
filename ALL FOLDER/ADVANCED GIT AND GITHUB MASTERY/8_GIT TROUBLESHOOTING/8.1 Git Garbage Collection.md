Git's garbage collection (`git gc`) is a crucial maintenance process that optimizes your repository by cleaning up loose objects and packing them into packfiles. Over time, as you commit, branch, and delete files, Git can accumulate loose objects (unreferenced objects) that take up space and slow down operations. `git gc` identifies and removes these unnecessary objects, improving repository performance and reducing its size. It also consolidates similar objects into packfiles, which are more efficient for storage and transfer.

Think of it like tidying up your workspace. After a big project (lots of commits and branches), you might have scraps of paper (loose objects) lying around. `git gc` is like sweeping up those scraps and organizing the important documents (objects) into labeled folders (packfiles). Git automatically runs `git gc --auto` periodically, but you can manually trigger a full garbage collection with `git gc --prune=now --aggressive`. The `--prune=now` option removes unreachable objects immediately, and `--aggressive` performs more thorough optimization, potentially taking longer.

For example, if you delete a large branch containing many commits, those commits might linger as loose objects. Running `git gc` will identify and remove them, reclaiming disk space. Another example is when you rewrite history using `git rebase` or `git commit --amend`. The original commits become unreachable and are eventually garbage collected.
