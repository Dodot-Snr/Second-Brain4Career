Losing commits can be a stressful experience, but Git provides several mechanisms to recover them. This section explores techniques for retrieving commits that might seem permanently gone, whether due to accidental resets, rebases gone wrong, or simply forgetting which branch a commit was made on. Understanding Git's internal workings, particularly the reflog, is crucial for successful recovery.

The `git reflog` command is your first line of defense. It records updates to the tip of branches and other references, essentially providing a history of where your HEAD has been. Even if a branch is deleted or a commit is orphaned, the reflog often retains a record of it. For example, if you accidentally hard reset to an earlier commit using `git reset --hard HEAD~3`, you can use `git reflog` to find the SHA of the commit you reset from and then `git reset --hard <SHA>` to return to that state.

Another useful tool is `git fsck --full --no-reflogs --unreachable --lost-found`. This command searches for unreachable objects (commits, trees, blobs) that are not referenced by any branch, tag, or reflog entry. It places any found objects in `.git/lost-found`, allowing you to examine them and potentially recover valuable work. Remember that Git's garbage collection will eventually remove these unreachable objects, so act quickly when you realize commits are missing.
