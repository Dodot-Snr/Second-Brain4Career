Losing commits can be a stressful experience, but Git provides several tools to help you locate them. These tools allow you to search through Git's internal records, even for commits that are no longer referenced by any branch or tag. Understanding how to use these tools is crucial for effective recovery.

One of the most useful commands for finding lost commits is `git reflog`. The reflog records updates to the tip of branches and other references, allowing you to see where your HEAD has been, even if you haven't committed anything. For example, if you accidentally hard reset your branch to an older commit, you can use `git reflog` to find the commit hash of the lost commit and then `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` to restore your branch to that point.

Another powerful tool is `git fsck --full --no-reflogs --unreachable --lost-found`. This command checks the integrity of the Git repository and identifies unreachable objects, including commits that are no longer referenced. It places these "lost" commits in the `.git/lost-found/commit` directory, allowing you to examine them and potentially recover them. Remember that `git fsck` is a more aggressive search and should be used if `git reflog` doesn't yield the desired results.
