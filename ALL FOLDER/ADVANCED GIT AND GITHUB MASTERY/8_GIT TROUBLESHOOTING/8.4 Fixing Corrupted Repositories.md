Repository corruption is a nightmare scenario for any developer. It can manifest in various ways, from Git commands failing unexpectedly to data loss. Understanding the causes of corruption and knowing how to diagnose and fix it is crucial for maintaining data integrity and project continuity. Common causes include hardware failures, file system errors, and even accidental manual modification of Git's internal files.

This section will equip you with the knowledge and tools to identify and resolve repository corruption. We'll explore techniques like using `git fsck --full --strict` to detect errors, recovering lost objects with `git fsck --lost-found`, and using `git prune` to remove unreachable objects. We'll also cover more advanced recovery methods, such as cloning a fresh copy of the repository and cherry-picking commits, or using `git replace` to graft a good commit onto a corrupted history. For example, if `git fsck` reports a corrupted object, you might try running `git prune` followed by `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` to clean up the repository.
