Repository size can significantly impact performance, especially for large projects. Bloated repositories lead to slower cloning, fetching, and pushing, impacting developer productivity and storage costs. Optimizing repository size is a crucial aspect of Git garbage collection, focusing on removing unnecessary data and restructuring the repository for efficiency. This involves identifying and removing large files, rewriting history to eliminate sensitive data, and leveraging Git's built-in tools to repack and prune the repository.

One common culprit for large repositories is the accidental inclusion of large binary files (e.g., images, videos, executables) directly into the Git history. Tools like `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` can be used to rewrite the repository's history, effectively removing these files from all commits. For example, if you accidentally committed a large file named `huge_image.png`, you could use `git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 10M` to remove all blobs larger than 10MB, including `huge_image.png`. Another example is using `git lfs` to manage large files.

Beyond removing large files, optimizing repository size also involves running `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` to repack the repository, remove unreachable objects, and compress data. This command aggressively cleans up the repository, reducing its overall size and improving performance. Regularly performing these optimization steps as part of your Git garbage collection routine ensures a lean and efficient repository.
