When Git encounters a merge conflict it cannot automatically resolve, it's up to you to manually edit the conflicted files to create a unified version. This involves examining the conflicting sections, understanding the changes from both branches, and deciding which changes to keep, modify, or combine. Manual conflict resolution is a crucial skill for any Git user, especially when dealing with complex or overlapping changes.

Git marks conflicts within the file using special markers: `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch_name`. The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents the changes from your current branch (HEAD), while the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch_name` represents the changes from the branch you're merging. Your task is to edit the file, removing these markers and creating a version that incorporates the desired changes.

For example, imagine two developers modified the same line in a `README.md` file. After attempting to merge, the file might look like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a project description on the main branch.
=======
This is a project description on the feature branch, with added details.
>>>>>>> feature/new-feature
```

To resolve this, you might choose to keep the feature branch's description, combine both descriptions, or write a completely new one. After editing, the file might look like this:

```
This is a project description with details from both the main and feature branches.
```

Once you've resolved all conflicts in a file, you stage the changes (`git add <file>`) and continue the merge process (`git commit`).
