Git is designed to efficiently track changes in text-based files. However, it struggles with large binary files like audio, video, datasets, and graphics. Storing these directly in a Git repository can lead to several problems, including slow cloning and fetching, increased repository size, and performance bottlenecks. This is where Git LFS comes in, but even with LFS, issues can arise.

Common problems include incorrect LFS configuration, leading to large files being stored directly in the Git repository despite the intention to use LFS. Another issue is forgetting to track new large files with `git lfs track`, resulting in them being committed without LFS. Furthermore, network issues or LFS server downtime can disrupt the download of large files during cloning or checkout, causing build failures or incomplete repositories.

For example, imagine a game development team using Git to manage their project. They might accidentally commit a large, uncompressed texture file (e.g., a 500MB PNG) directly to the repository. This will bloat the repository size and slow down operations for everyone. Alternatively, if the LFS server hosting the large audio files for the game goes down, developers might be unable to build the game locally because they can't download the necessary assets.
