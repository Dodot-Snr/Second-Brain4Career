Merge conflicts are an inevitable part of collaborative software development when working with Git. They arise when Git is unable to automatically reconcile changes made on different branches that modify the same lines in the same file. Understanding how to effectively resolve these conflicts is crucial for maintaining a clean and functional codebase. When a merge conflict occurs, Git marks the conflicting sections in the affected file with special markers, indicating the conflicting changes from different branches.

Resolving a merge conflict involves manually editing the affected file to choose which changes to keep, modify, or combine. You'll need to carefully examine the conflicting sections, understand the intent of the changes from each branch, and then make a decision on how to integrate them. After resolving the conflicts, you stage the modified file and commit the changes to complete the merge.

For example, imagine two developers, Alice and Bob, are working on the same `README.md` file. Alice modifies the introduction paragraph on her branch, while Bob updates the installation instructions on his branch, also in the introduction paragraph. When they try to merge their branches, Git will detect a conflict because both developers modified the same section of the file. The `README.md` file will then contain conflict markers like `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch_name`, indicating the conflicting sections. Alice or Bob (or both) will then need to edit the file, removing the conflict markers and deciding on the final content for the introduction paragraph, potentially combining both sets of changes.
