While global Git configuration provides a convenient baseline, sometimes you need settings specific to a particular repository. This is where overriding global configuration comes in. Git allows you to define settings at the repository level, which take precedence over global settings. This ensures that certain behaviors, like commit author or code style preferences, are enforced only within that project.

Repository-specific configuration is stored in the `.git/config` file within the repository's root directory. You can modify this file directly or, more commonly, use the `git config` command with the `--local` flag. For example, if you want to use a different email address for commits in a specific project, you would run:

```bash
git config --local user.email "project-specific@example.com"
```

This ensures that all commits in this repository will use the specified email address, regardless of your global `user.email` setting. Similarly, you might want to ignore certain files or patterns specific to a project. You can achieve this by creating or modifying the `.gitignore` file in the repository's root. These local configurations provide granular control over Git's behavior on a per-project basis, promoting consistency and collaboration within teams.
