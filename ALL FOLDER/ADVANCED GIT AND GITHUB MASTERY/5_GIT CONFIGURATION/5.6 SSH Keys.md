SSH keys provide a more secure way to authenticate with Git servers like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket compared to using passwords. Instead of typing your password every time you interact with the remote repository, you use a cryptographic key pair: a private key that stays securely on your computer and a public key that you upload to the Git server. When you try to push or pull, your Git client uses the private key to prove your identity to the server, which verifies it against the corresponding public key. This eliminates the risk of exposing your password and offers a more streamlined workflow.

The process involves generating an SSH key pair using a tool like `ssh-keygen`. You then add the public key to your GitHub account settings. From that point forward, Git operations will use the SSH key for authentication. For example, after setting up SSH keys, you can clone a repository using the SSH URL (e.g., `git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git`) instead of the HTTPS URL. This eliminates the need to enter your username and password repeatedly.

```bash
# Example of generating an SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Example of cloning a repository using SSH
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
```
