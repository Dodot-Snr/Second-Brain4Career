Line endings are a common source of frustration when collaborating on Git repositories across different operating systems. Windows uses carriage return and line feed characters (CRLF, `\r\n`) to mark the end of a line, while Unix-based systems (like macOS and Linux) use only a line feed character (LF, `\n`). Git can automatically handle these differences to prevent unnecessary changes and conflicts. This is achieved through the `core.autocrlf` configuration setting and the `.gitattributes` file.

The `.gitattributes` file allows you to specify how Git should handle line endings for specific file types. For example, you can tell Git to always convert line endings to LF when committing a file, regardless of the operating system. This ensures consistency across the repository. A common use case is to normalize text files to LF while leaving binary files untouched.

Here's an example of a `.gitattributes` file:

```
*.txt text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
*.png binary
```

This configuration tells Git to treat all `.txt` and `.sh` files as text and normalize their line endings to LF. The `*.png` entry tells Git to treat PNG files as binary, preventing any line ending conversion. Understanding and properly configuring line endings is crucial for maintaining a clean and consistent Git history, especially in cross-platform development environments.
