Git attributes allow you to define specific behaviors for files and directories within your repository. One powerful application of git attributes is customizing how Git highlights differences (diffs) for particular file types. This is especially useful for making diffs more readable and relevant for complex or specialized file formats. By configuring diff highlighting, you can improve code review efficiency and better understand changes made to your project.

The `diff` attribute in `.gitattributes` allows you to specify a custom diff driver for specific file types. This driver defines how Git should compare and display changes. For example, you might want to ignore whitespace changes in Python files or use a specialized diff tool for comparing image files. To achieve this, you first define the diff driver in your `.gitconfig` file and then associate it with the relevant file types in your `.gitattributes` file.

Here's an example. Let's say you want to ignore whitespace changes in all `.py` files. First, define a diff driver in your `.gitconfig`:

```
[diff "python"]
    binary = false
    xfuncname = ^[ \t]*def[ \t]+([^(\n]*)
    command = python -m flake8 --diff
```

Then, in your `.gitattributes` file, add the following line:

```
*.py diff=python
```

This tells Git to use the "python" diff driver for all `.py` files, effectively ignoring whitespace differences during diff operations.
