Adding an SSH key to your GitHub account allows you to securely connect to GitHub repositories without needing to enter your username and password every time. This is particularly useful for automating tasks, working with CI/CD pipelines, and generally streamlining your Git workflow. SSH keys provide a more secure and convenient alternative to HTTPS authentication.

The process involves generating a new SSH key pair (a public and a private key) on your local machine. The private key should be kept secret and stored securely on your computer. The public key is then added to your GitHub account. When you interact with a GitHub repository using Git over SSH, your local Git client uses the private key to authenticate with GitHub, which verifies the authentication against the stored public key.

For example, after generating your SSH key pair, you would copy the contents of your public key file (typically `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) and paste it into the "SSH and GPG keys" section of your GitHub account settings. Once added, you can clone repositories using the SSH URL (e.g., `git@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git`) and push/pull changes without being prompted for your credentials.
