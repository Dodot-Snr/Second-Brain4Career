Global Git configuration allows you to set preferences that apply to all your Git repositories on your system. This is incredibly useful for setting your name and email, default editor, and other settings you want to use consistently across all projects. Instead of configuring each repository individually, you can define these settings once and have them automatically applied.

The global configuration file is typically located in your home directory (`~/.gitconfig` on Linux/macOS, or `%USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig` on Windows). You can modify it directly or, more commonly, use the `git config --global` command. For example, to set your name and email, you would use:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Another common use case is setting a default text editor for Git operations like commit message editing. For example, to set VS Code as your default editor:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

By leveraging global configuration, you streamline your Git workflow and ensure consistency across all your projects.
