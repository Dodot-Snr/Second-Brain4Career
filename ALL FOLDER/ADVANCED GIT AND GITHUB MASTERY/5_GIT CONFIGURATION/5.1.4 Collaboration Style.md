Once you've chosen a Git workflow, the next step is defining your team's collaboration style. This dictates how team members interact with the chosen workflow, impacting code review processes, communication channels, and overall team dynamics. A well-defined collaboration style ensures smoother integration, reduces conflicts, and promotes knowledge sharing. It's about establishing clear expectations and guidelines for how developers contribute to the project.

Different collaboration styles suit different team sizes and project complexities. For instance, a small team might thrive with informal code reviews and direct communication, while a larger team might benefit from a more structured approach with mandatory pull requests and dedicated code reviewers. Consider factors like team experience, project criticality, and the frequency of code changes when selecting a collaboration style.

For example, a team might adopt a "strict code review" style where every pull request requires approval from at least two senior developers before merging. Alternatively, a team might opt for a more relaxed "peer review" style where developers are encouraged to review each other's code but approval isn't strictly mandatory for all changes. The choice depends on the team's needs and priorities.
