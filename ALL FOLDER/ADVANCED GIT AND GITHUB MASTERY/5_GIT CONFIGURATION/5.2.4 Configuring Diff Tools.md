Git's ability to show you the differences between versions of your code is crucial for understanding changes and resolving conflicts. While Git has a built-in diff tool, you can configure it to use more powerful and visually appealing external diff tools. This allows for easier comparison of files, especially when dealing with complex changes or large files. Configuring a diff tool globally ensures that it's used across all your Git repositories on your system.

To configure a global diff tool, you'll typically use the `git config` command with the `--global` flag. For example, to configure Git to use `meld` as your diff tool, you would run: `git config --global diff.tool meld`. You might also need to configure the `difftool.meld.cmd` setting to specify the command to launch `meld` with the correct arguments. This might look like: `git config --global difftool.meld.cmd "meld \"\$LOCAL\" \"\$REMOTE\""`.

Once configured, you can use the `git difftool` command to launch your chosen diff tool when comparing files. For instance, `git difftool myfile.txt` will open `meld` (or your configured tool) to compare the current version of `myfile.txt` with its last committed version. This provides a more user-friendly and feature-rich experience compared to the default Git diff output.
