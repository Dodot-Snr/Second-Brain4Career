One of the most useful global configurations you can set in Git is your preferred text editor. Git uses this editor for various tasks, such as writing commit messages, resolving merge conflicts, and more. By default, Git often defaults to `vi` or `vim`, which can be intimidating for new users. Configuring your editor allows you to use a more familiar and comfortable environment, streamlining your workflow.

To configure your editor globally, you'll use the `git config` command with the `--global` flag. For example, to set Visual Studio Code as your editor, you would use the following command:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

Similarly, if you prefer using Nano, you can configure it with:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

After setting your editor, Git will automatically use it whenever it needs you to write or edit text. This simple configuration can significantly improve your Git experience, making it more efficient and enjoyable.
