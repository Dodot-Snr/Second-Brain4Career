SSH (Secure Shell) keys provide a more secure and convenient way to authenticate with Git repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket compared to using HTTPS and passwords. Instead of typing your password every time you interact with a remote repository, SSH keys allow you to establish a trusted connection between your local machine and the remote server using cryptographic key pairs. This eliminates the need to repeatedly enter your credentials, streamlining your workflow and reducing the risk of exposing your password.

The process involves generating a pair of keys: a private key, which you keep securely on your local machine, and a public key, which you upload to your Git hosting provider. When you attempt to connect to the remote repository, your Git client uses the private key to digitally sign a request. The server verifies this signature using the corresponding public key. If the signature is valid, you are authenticated without needing to enter your password. For example, after setting up SSH keys, you can clone a repository using `git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git` without being prompted for your password.

Using SSH authentication not only enhances security but also simplifies common Git operations like pushing, pulling, and fetching. It's particularly beneficial when working with multiple repositories or automating Git tasks, as it eliminates the need for manual password entry. Furthermore, SSH keys can be protected with a passphrase for an extra layer of security, requiring you to enter the passphrase only once per session.
