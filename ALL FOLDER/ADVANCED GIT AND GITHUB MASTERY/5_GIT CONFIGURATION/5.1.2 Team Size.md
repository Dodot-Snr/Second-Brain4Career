The size of your development team is a crucial factor when selecting a Git workflow. Smaller teams (2-5 developers) can often thrive with simpler workflows like Gitflow or even a centralized workflow, as communication overhead is low and coordination is relatively easy. Larger teams (10+ developers), however, require more structured and robust workflows to manage complexity, prevent integration conflicts, and maintain a consistent development pace. Ignoring team size can lead to bottlenecks, merge conflicts, and ultimately, slower development cycles.

For example, a small team working on a personal project might find a simple centralized workflow sufficient. Developers commit directly to the `main` branch after testing locally. However, a large team working on a complex enterprise application would likely benefit from a more sophisticated workflow like GitHub Flow or GitLab Flow, which emphasizes frequent branching, pull requests, and automated testing to ensure code quality and stability. These workflows provide better isolation of changes and facilitate thorough code review, which is essential for larger teams.
