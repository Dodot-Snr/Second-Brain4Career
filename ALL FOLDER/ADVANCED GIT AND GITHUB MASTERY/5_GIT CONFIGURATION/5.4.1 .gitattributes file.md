The `.gitattributes` file is a powerful tool in Git that allows you to define attributes for specific files or file types within your repository. These attributes can influence how Git handles line endings, diffs, merges, and more. Unlike `.gitignore`, which tells Git to ignore certain files, `.gitattributes` instructs Git on _how_ to treat specific files. This is particularly useful for ensuring consistency across different operating systems and development environments. The file resides in the root of your repository, but attributes can also be defined in `.git/info/attributes` for repository-specific settings that are not shared, or in `$GIT_DIR/attributes` for global settings.

By using `.gitattributes`, you can enforce consistent line endings (e.g., converting all text files to use LF line endings), specify custom merge strategies for certain file types, or tell Git to treat binary files as binary to prevent accidental corruption during merges. This level of control is crucial for collaborative projects where developers may be using different operating systems or IDEs. It helps avoid common issues like line ending conflicts and ensures that Git handles files in the most appropriate way.

For example, to ensure all `.txt` files use LF line endings, you would add the following line to your `.gitattributes` file:

```
*.txt text eol=lf
```

Another common use case is to tell Git to treat certain files as binary, preventing it from trying to diff them as text:

```
*.png binary
```
