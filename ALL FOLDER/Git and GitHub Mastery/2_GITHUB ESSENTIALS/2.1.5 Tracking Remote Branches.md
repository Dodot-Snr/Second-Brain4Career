Tracking remote branches establishes a direct link between a local branch and a remote branch. This connection simplifies common Git operations by allowing you to push and pull changes without explicitly specifying the remote and branch names each time. When a local branch is tracking a remote branch, Git knows where to fetch updates from and where to push your local commits to.

By default, when you clone a repository, Git automatically sets up tracking connections for the remote `origin` and its branches. However, you might need to manually set up tracking for branches you create locally or for branches on other remotes. For example, if you create a new branch `feature/new-design` locally and want to track the `origin/feature/new-design` branch, you can use the command `git push --set-upstream origin feature/new-design`. After this, `git pull` and `git push` will work seamlessly on that branch.

Tracking branches streamline your workflow. Instead of typing `git push origin feature/new-design` every time, you can simply use `git push`. Similarly, `git pull` will automatically fetch and merge changes from the tracked remote branch. This makes collaborating with remote repositories much more efficient and less prone to errors.
