GitHub is more than just a place to store code; it's a collaborative platform built around several core concepts. Understanding repositories, issues, pull requests, and actions is crucial for effective collaboration and project management. A **repository** (or "repo") is essentially a project folder containing all the project's files, history, and metadata. Think of it as the central hub for your project. **Issues** are used to track bugs, feature requests, tasks, or any other kind of discussion related to the project. They provide a structured way to manage and prioritize work.

**Pull requests** (PRs) are proposals to merge changes from one branch into another. They allow for code review and discussion before changes are integrated into the main codebase. For example, if you're working on a new feature in a separate branch, you'd create a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch. Other developers can then review your code, provide feedback, and suggest changes before the merge happens. Finally, **GitHub Actions** are automated workflows that can be triggered by events in your repository, such as pushing code, creating a pull request, or scheduling tasks. Actions can be used for a wide range of tasks, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), automated testing, and more. For example, you could set up an action to automatically run tests every time code is pushed to the repository.
