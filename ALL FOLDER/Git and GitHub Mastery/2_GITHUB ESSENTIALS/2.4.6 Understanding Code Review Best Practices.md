Code review is a critical part of the pull request workflow, ensuring code quality, knowledge sharing, and team consistency. It involves having other developers examine your proposed changes before they are merged into the main codebase. Effective code reviews go beyond simply looking for bugs; they focus on readability, maintainability, performance, and adherence to coding standards. By embracing best practices, teams can significantly improve the overall quality of their software.

A key aspect of code review is providing constructive feedback. Instead of saying "This code is bad," a better approach is to explain _why_ it's problematic and suggest improvements. For example, instead of "This function is too long," try "This function is quite lengthy and could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and testability." Another best practice is to focus on specific areas. For instance, if you notice a potential security vulnerability, highlight it with a clear explanation of the risk and a suggested solution.

Consider this example: a reviewer might suggest refactoring a complex conditional statement for better readability.

```python
# Original code
if (user.is_admin and user.has_permission("edit")) or (user.is_moderator and post.is_approved):
    allow_edit = True
else:
    allow_edit = False

# Improved code
is_admin_with_edit_permission = user.is_admin and user.has_permission("edit")
is_moderator_approving_post = user.is_moderator and post.is_approved

allow_edit = is_admin_with_edit_permission or is_moderator_approving_post
```

The improved code, while functionally equivalent, is easier to understand at a glance, demonstrating the value of focusing on readability during code review.
