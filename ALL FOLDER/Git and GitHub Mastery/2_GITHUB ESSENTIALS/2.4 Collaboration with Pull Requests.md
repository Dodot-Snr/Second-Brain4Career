Pull Requests (PRs) are the cornerstone of collaborative development on platforms like GitHub. They provide a structured and transparent way for developers to propose changes to a codebase, allowing for review, discussion, and automated testing before integration. Instead of directly committing to the main branch (often `main` or `master`), developers create a branch, make their changes, and then submit a PR to merge their branch into the target branch. This process ensures code quality and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.

The PR process typically involves the following steps: creating a branch, making changes, pushing the branch to a remote repository, opening a PR, engaging in code review, addressing feedback, and finally, merging the PR. For example, imagine you're fixing a bug in a website's navigation. You'd create a branch called `fix-navigation-bug`, implement the fix, and then open a PR targeting the `main` branch. Other developers can then review your code, suggest improvements, and once everyone is satisfied, the PR can be merged.

A key benefit of using PRs is the ability to leverage automated checks. These checks can include running tests, linting code, and verifying code style. For instance, a PR might fail if the newly introduced code doesn't pass the unit tests or if it violates the project's coding standards. This automated feedback loop helps catch errors early and ensures code consistency.

```python
# Example of a failing test that would cause a PR to fail
def test_addition():
    assert 1 + 1 == 3 # This assertion will fail
```
