Conflicts in pull requests arise when changes made in the branch you're trying to merge clash with changes in the target branch (usually `main` or `develop`). This typically happens when multiple developers have modified the same lines of code, or when one developer has deleted a file that another has modified. GitHub will flag these conflicts, preventing the pull request from being merged until they are resolved.

Resolving conflicts involves manually editing the affected files to reconcile the differing changes. Git provides markers within the file to highlight the conflicting sections, showing both the changes from your branch and the changes from the target branch. You'll need to decide which changes to keep, modify, or combine to create a final, consistent version. For example, if one developer changed a variable name in `config.py` and another developer added a new configuration option in the same file, you'll need to integrate both changes while ensuring the code remains functional.

Once you've resolved all conflicts, you stage the modified files using `git add`, commit the changes with a descriptive message (e.g., "Resolve merge conflicts in [config.py](http://config.py)"), and push the updated branch to GitHub. This will update the pull request, and if all conflicts are resolved, the merge button will become available.
