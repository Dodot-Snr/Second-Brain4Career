GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that directly takes files from a repository on GitHub and publishes them as a website. It's a fantastic way to showcase your projects, create a portfolio, or build a simple website without needing a dedicated web server. GitHub Pages supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby. This makes it incredibly versatile for various projects, from simple landing pages to more complex documentation sites.

To get started with GitHub Pages, you typically create a repository named `username.github.io` (where `username` is your GitHub username) or use a branch named `gh-pages` in an existing repository. Then, you add your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to the repository. GitHub automatically builds and deploys your site, making it accessible via a URL like `https://username.github.io` or `https://username.github.io/repository-name`.

For example, if you have a simple HTML file named `index.html` in your `username.github.io` repository with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My GitHub Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first GitHub Page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

GitHub Pages will serve this file, and you'll see "Hello, World!" displayed on your website. This ease of use and integration with Git makes GitHub Pages an invaluable tool for developers and anyone looking to quickly deploy a static website.
