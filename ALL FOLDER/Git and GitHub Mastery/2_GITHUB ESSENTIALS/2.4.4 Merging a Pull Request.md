Once a pull request has been reviewed, discussed, and approved, the next step is to merge it into the target branch (typically `main` or `develop`). Merging integrates the changes from the feature branch into the main codebase. GitHub offers several merge strategies, including:

- **Merge commit:** Creates a new merge commit on the target branch, preserving the history of the feature branch.
- **Squash and merge:** Combines all commits from the feature branch into a single commit on the target branch, creating a cleaner history.
- **Rebase and merge:** Replays the commits from the feature branch onto the target branch, resulting in a linear history.

For example, if you have a pull request with three commits addressing a new feature, using "Squash and merge" will result in a single commit on the `main` branch summarizing the entire feature. Conversely, using "Merge commit" will preserve all three individual commits from the feature branch, along with a merge commit indicating the integration. The choice of strategy depends on the project's history management preferences. After selecting a merge strategy, clicking the "Merge pull request" button on GitHub initiates the merge process.
