`git fetch` is a crucial command for collaborating with remote repositories. Unlike `git pull`, which both downloads changes _and_ merges them into your working branch, `git fetch` _only_ downloads the changes from the remote repository. This allows you to review the changes before deciding how (or if) to integrate them into your local branch. Think of it as checking the mail without immediately opening and sorting through it.

When you run `git fetch origin`, Git retrieves all the new commits, branches, and tags from the `origin` remote (typically your main remote repository) and stores them in your local repository as remote-tracking branches (e.g., `origin/main`, `origin/develop`). These remote-tracking branches are read-only and serve as a mirror of the remote repository's state at the time of the fetch. You can then use commands like `git diff origin/main` to see the differences between your local `main` branch and the remote `main` branch, or `git log origin/main` to examine the new commits.

For example, if a teammate pushed new commits to the `origin/develop` branch, running `git fetch origin` will update your local `origin/develop` remote-tracking branch. You can then examine these changes before merging them into your local `develop` branch using `git merge origin/develop` or creating a new branch based on the fetched changes. This gives you greater control and allows for safer integration of remote changes.
