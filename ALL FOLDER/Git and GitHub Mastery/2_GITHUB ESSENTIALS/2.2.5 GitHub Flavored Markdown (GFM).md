GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) is a superset of standard Markdown that adds several useful features specifically designed for GitHub's platform. It allows you to format text, create lists, embed code, and much more, all within your repositories' README files, issues, pull requests, and comments. GFM enhances readability and collaboration by providing a consistent and feature-rich formatting experience across GitHub.

Some key additions in GFM include task lists, tables, and fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting. Task lists are great for tracking progress on issues or pull requests. Tables allow you to present data in a structured format. Fenced code blocks enable you to display code snippets with proper syntax highlighting, making them easier to read and understand.

For example, here's how you can create a task list:

```markdown
- [x] Complete the tutorial
- [ ] Write the documentation
- [ ] Deploy the application
```

And here's an example of a fenced code block with syntax highlighting for JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```
