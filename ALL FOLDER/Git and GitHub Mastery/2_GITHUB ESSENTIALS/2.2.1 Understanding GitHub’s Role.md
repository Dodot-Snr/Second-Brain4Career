GitHub is more than just a website; it's a collaborative platform built around Git version control. It serves as a central hub for developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code. Think of it as a social network for programmers, where you can share your projects, contribute to others' work, and track changes to code over time. GitHub provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Git repositories, making it easier to manage complex projects and work with teams.

One of GitHub's primary roles is to host Git repositories. This allows developers to store their code in the cloud, ensuring its safety and accessibility. For example, a team working on a web application can store all their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in a GitHub repository. Another key role is facilitating collaboration through features like pull requests, which allow developers to propose changes to a codebase and have them reviewed by others before merging. Imagine a developer fixing a bug; they can create a pull request with their fix, and other team members can review the code and provide feedback before it's integrated into the main project.
