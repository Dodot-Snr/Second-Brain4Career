The `git push` command is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository, like GitHub. It essentially uploads your local changes, allowing others to see and collaborate on your work. Think of it as synchronizing your local copy with the central, shared repository. Without pushing, your changes remain isolated on your machine.

`git push` requires you to specify the remote repository and the branch you want to push to. The basic syntax is `git push <remote> <branch>`. For example, if you want to push your local `main` branch to the `origin` remote (which is often the default name for your main remote repository), you would use the command `git push origin main`. This command sends all commits from your local `main` branch that are not already present in the `origin/main` branch on the remote.

A common scenario is pushing a new branch to the remote. Let's say you created a branch called `feature/new-button`. To push this branch to the remote and set up tracking, you can use `git push -u origin feature/new-button`. The `-u` flag (short for `--set-upstream`) establishes a tracking connection between your local `feature/new-button` branch and the remote `origin/feature/new-button` branch. This allows you to use simpler commands like `git push` and `git pull` in the future without specifying the remote and branch each time.
