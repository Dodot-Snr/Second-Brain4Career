Code signing is a crucial security practice that involves digitally signing your Git commits and tags to verify their authenticity and integrity. This ensures that the code you're sharing hasn't been tampered with and that it truly originates from you. By implementing code signing, you provide recipients with confidence in the source and reliability of your code, mitigating the risk of malicious code injection or impersonation.

To implement code signing, you'll typically use GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) or SSH keys. You configure Git to use your key to sign commits and tags. For example, after setting up GPG, you can sign a commit using the `-S` flag: `git commit -S -m "Signed commit message"`. Similarly, you can sign a tag with `git tag -s v1.0 -m "Signed tag"`. GitHub then visually verifies these signatures, providing a clear indication of the commit's or tag's authenticity.

Properly implemented code signing adds a significant layer of trust to your Git workflow, especially in open-source projects or collaborative environments where multiple developers contribute. It helps protect against supply chain attacks and ensures that users can confidently rely on the code they're using.
