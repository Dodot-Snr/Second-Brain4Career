Storing credentials directly in your Git repository is a major security risk. Anyone with access to the repository's history can potentially retrieve those credentials, leading to unauthorized access to your systems and data. This section focuses on best practices for avoiding this pitfall and securely managing your credentials when working with Git and GitHub.

Instead of embedding credentials directly in your code or configuration files, utilize environment variables or dedicated credential management tools. Environment variables allow you to store sensitive information outside of your repository and access them within your application. For example, instead of hardcoding your database password, you can set an environment variable named `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and retrieve it in your code. Another approach is to use tools like `git-credential-manager` which securely stores your GitHub credentials and automatically provides them when needed, eliminating the need to repeatedly enter your username and password.

By adopting these secure credential storage practices, you significantly reduce the risk of accidental exposure and maintain the integrity of your Git repository and associated systems. Remember to regularly review your codebase and configurations to ensure no credentials are inadvertently stored in plain text.
