Data science projects often involve large datasets, models, and other binary files that can quickly bloat a Git repository. Storing these directly in Git can lead to performance issues, slow cloning times, and storage limitations. Git Large File Storage (LFS) is an extension that allows you to track large files in your repository while storing the actual file content separately. This keeps your Git repository lean and efficient.

Git LFS works by replacing large files in your repository with text pointers. When you clone or checkout a repository, Git LFS automatically downloads the actual file content from a separate LFS server. This means that only the files you need are downloaded, saving bandwidth and storage space. For example, you might use Git LFS to manage large image datasets used for training a computer vision model or pre-trained language models.

To start using Git LFS, you first need to install it and then track the files you want to manage with LFS. For instance, to track all `.csv` files larger than 10MB, you would use the command:

```bash
git lfs track "*.csv"
```

This command creates a `.gitattributes` file that tells Git LFS to manage all `.csv` files. After tracking, you commit the `.gitattributes` file and the large files as usual. Git LFS will then handle the storage and retrieval of the actual file content.
