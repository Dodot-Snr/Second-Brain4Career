Web development thrives on collaboration and iterative improvements, making Git an indispensable tool. This section focuses on how Git streamlines the development process for web projects, from managing code changes to deploying updates. You'll learn how to effectively use Git to track modifications to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web-related files, ensuring a smooth and organized workflow.

Git allows web developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously using branches. For example, one developer might be working on a new user interface feature in a branch called `feature/new-ui`, while another is fixing a bug in the `bugfix/login-issue` branch. This isolation prevents conflicts and allows for independent development. Once the changes are tested and approved, they can be merged back into the main branch (`main` or `develop`).

Furthermore, Git simplifies deployment. By tagging specific commits as releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`), you can easily revert to previous versions if necessary. Using Git with platforms like Netlify or Vercel allows for automated deployments whenever changes are pushed to a specific branch, streamlining the process of getting your web application live.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
