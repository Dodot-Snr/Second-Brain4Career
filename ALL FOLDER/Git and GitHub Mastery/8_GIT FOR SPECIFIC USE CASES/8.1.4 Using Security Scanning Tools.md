Security scanning tools are essential for identifying vulnerabilities in your code and dependencies within your Git repositories and GitHub projects. Integrating these tools into your workflow helps proactively address potential security risks before they can be exploited. These tools automate the process of analyzing your codebase for common security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure dependencies. By regularly scanning your projects, you can maintain a more secure and robust software development lifecycle.

There are various types of security scanning tools available, including static analysis security testing (SAST), dynamic analysis security testing (DAST), and software composition analysis (SCA). SAST tools analyze source code without executing it, identifying potential vulnerabilities based on coding patterns and rules. DAST tools, on the other hand, analyze the application while it's running, simulating real-world attacks to uncover vulnerabilities. SCA tools focus on identifying and managing open-source dependencies, flagging known vulnerabilities and license compliance issues. For example, GitHub's Dependabot alerts you to vulnerable dependencies in your project's `package.json` or `requirements.txt` file. Another example is using a SAST tool like SonarQube to analyze your code for potential security flaws before committing changes.

```python
# Example of a potential SQL injection vulnerability
user_input = input("Enter your username: ")
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user_input + "'"
# This query is vulnerable to SQL injection if user_input is not properly sanitized.
```
