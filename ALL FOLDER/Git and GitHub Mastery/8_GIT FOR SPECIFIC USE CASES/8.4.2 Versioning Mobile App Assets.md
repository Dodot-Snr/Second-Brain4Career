Mobile app development involves a multitude of assets, including images, audio files, videos, fonts, and configuration files. Effectively versioning these assets is crucial for maintaining consistency, enabling collaboration, and facilitating rollbacks. Git, primarily known for code versioning, can also be leveraged to manage these assets, although large binary files require special consideration. By storing assets in a Git repository, you can track changes, revert to previous versions, and ensure that all team members are working with the correct resources.

One common approach is to store smaller assets directly in the Git repository. For example, icon sets, splash screens, and configuration files are typically small enough to be efficiently managed by Git. However, large assets like high-resolution videos or extensive audio libraries can bloat the repository and slow down operations. In such cases, Git Large File Storage (LFS) is recommended. Git LFS stores pointers to the actual asset files, which are stored separately, keeping the repository lean while still providing version control.

For example, consider a mobile game project. You might use Git to version control the code, UI layouts, and smaller image assets. For larger assets like character models or background textures, you would use Git LFS. This ensures that the repository remains manageable while still providing a complete history of all project assets. Another example is managing different versions of localized audio files for an app. Git allows you to easily switch between different language versions and track changes made to each.
