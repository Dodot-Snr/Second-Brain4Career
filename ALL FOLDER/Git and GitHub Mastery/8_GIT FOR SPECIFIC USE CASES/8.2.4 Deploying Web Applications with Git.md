Deploying web applications with Git involves using Git as a mechanism to transfer your code from your development environment to a production server. This process often leverages Git's branching and version control capabilities to ensure smooth and reliable deployments. Instead of manually copying files, you can use Git to pull the latest version of your code onto the server, making updates and rollbacks much easier. This approach is particularly useful when combined with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

A common deployment strategy involves pushing your code to a remote repository (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and then configuring your server to pull updates from that repository. For example, you might have a `main` branch that represents the production-ready code. When you merge changes into `main`, a post-receive hook on the server can automatically trigger a script that pulls the latest code, restarts the web server, and performs any necessary database migrations. Another example is using Git to deploy static websites directly to platforms like Netlify or Vercel, which automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to a specific branch.
