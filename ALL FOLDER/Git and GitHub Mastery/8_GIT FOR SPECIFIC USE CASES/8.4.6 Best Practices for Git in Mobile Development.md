Mobile development introduces unique challenges to Git workflows. Large binary files (images, videos, audio), frequent UI changes, and platform-specific configurations require careful management to avoid repository bloat and merge conflicts. Adopting best practices ensures efficient collaboration, streamlined deployments, and a maintainable codebase.

One crucial practice is using `.gitignore` effectively. Mobile projects often generate numerous temporary files, build artifacts, and platform-specific configurations that shouldn't be tracked. A well-configured `.gitignore` prevents these files from being committed, keeping the repository clean and reducing its size. For example, including `*.apk` (Android application package) or `*.ipa` (iOS application archive) in `.gitignore` prevents large build outputs from being tracked.

Another important aspect is managing sensitive information. Mobile apps often require API keys, database credentials, and other secrets. Storing these directly in the repository is a security risk. Instead, use environment variables or dedicated secret management tools and ensure that configuration files containing sensitive data are excluded from version control. For instance, you might have a `config.properties` file with API keys, which should be added to `.gitignore` and managed separately using environment variables on the build server or device.
