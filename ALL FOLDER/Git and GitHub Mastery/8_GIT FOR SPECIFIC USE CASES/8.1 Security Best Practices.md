Security is paramount when working with Git and GitHub, especially in collaborative environments. Neglecting security can lead to data breaches, code tampering, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. This section covers essential practices to protect your repositories and workflows. We'll explore techniques for managing secrets, controlling access, and ensuring code integrity.

One crucial aspect is avoiding committing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or private keys directly into your repository. Instead, use environment variables or dedicated secret management tools. For example, instead of hardcoding an API key in your code:

```python
# BAD PRACTICE - DO NOT DO THIS
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# GOOD PRACTICE - Use environment variables
import os
api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
```

Another key practice is to carefully manage branch permissions and access control. Use GitHub's built-in features to restrict who can push to protected branches like `main` or `develop`. Implement code review processes to catch potential vulnerabilities before they are merged into the codebase. Regularly audit your repository's security settings and dependencies to identify and address any potential risks.
