Front-end development, with its rapidly evolving frameworks and complex dependencies, benefits immensely from version control. Git allows front-end developers to track changes to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and configuration files, enabling collaboration, experimentation, and easy rollback to previous states. This section focuses on practical Git workflows tailored for front-end projects, covering essential aspects like branching strategies, managing assets, and collaborating effectively within a team.

A common scenario is using feature branches for developing new UI components or implementing specific functionalities. For example, you might create a branch named `feature/new-navbar` to work on a redesigned navigation bar. This isolates your changes from the main codebase until they are thoroughly tested and ready for integration. Another key aspect is managing dependencies using package managers like npm or yarn. Git helps track changes to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), ensuring consistent dependency versions across different environments and team members.

Furthermore, we'll explore how to handle large assets like images and fonts efficiently using Git LFS (Large File Storage) to avoid bloating the repository. We'll also cover best practices for writing effective commit messages that clearly communicate the purpose of each change, making it easier for team members to understand the project's history and collaborate effectively.
