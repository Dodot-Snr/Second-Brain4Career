Server-side hooks are powerful scripts that run on the remote repository when changes are pushed. Unlike client-side hooks, which are specific to a developer's local environment, server-side hooks enforce policies and automate tasks across the entire team. Two of the most commonly used server-side hooks are `pre-receive` and `post-receive`. These hooks reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of the remote repository.

The `pre-receive` hook executes _before_ any references are updated. It receives a list of references being pushed and can reject the entire push if any of the checks fail. This is ideal for enforcing coding standards, preventing large file commits, or ensuring commit messages adhere to a specific format. For example, you could use a `pre-receive` hook to reject pushes containing commits with author emails outside of your organization's domain.

The `post-receive` hook executes _after_ the references have been updated. It's typically used for tasks like deploying code to a production server, sending notifications, or updating issue trackers. A common example is triggering a build process on a continuous integration server after a successful push to the main branch.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Example post-receive hook to trigger a build
while read oldrev newrev refname
do
  if [[ $refname = refs/heads/main ]]; then
    echo "Push to main detected. Triggering build..."
    ssh user@buildserver "cd /path/to/build/directory && ./build.sh"
  fi
done
```
