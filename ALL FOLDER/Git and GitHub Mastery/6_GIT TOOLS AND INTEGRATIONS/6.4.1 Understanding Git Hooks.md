Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are a powerful way to automate and customize your Git workflow. By leveraging hooks, you can enforce coding standards, run tests, or even deploy code automatically. Hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory of your Git repository.

These scripts can be written in any scripting language, such as Bash, Python, or Ruby, as long as they are executable. Git provides sample hook scripts with a `.sample` extension in the `.git/hooks` directory. To activate a hook, simply remove the `.sample` extension and make the script executable.

For example, you could use a `pre-commit` hook to run a linter and prevent commits that don't adhere to your project's coding style. Another common use case is a `pre-push` hook that runs your test suite before allowing you to push changes to a remote repository, ensuring that only working code is pushed.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# A simple pre-commit hook to check for trailing whitespace

if git diff --cached --check --exit-code; then
  echo "No trailing whitespace detected."
else
  echo "Trailing whitespace detected. Please remove it before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```
