Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They can be leveraged to automate code quality checks and enforce security policies, ensuring a cleaner and more secure codebase. By integrating these hooks into your workflow, you can catch potential issues early in the development cycle, preventing them from reaching production.

For example, a `pre-commit` hook can run linters and formatters to ensure code adheres to a specific style guide. If the linter finds any violations, the commit is rejected, forcing the developer to fix the issues before proceeding. Another example is a `pre-push` hook that can scan for sensitive information like API keys or passwords within the code. If such information is detected, the push is blocked, preventing accidental exposure of credentials.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# pre-commit hook to check for trailing whitespace

if git diff --cached --check --exit-code; then
  echo "No trailing whitespace detected."
else
  echo "Trailing whitespace detected. Please remove it before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```

This simple `pre-commit` hook checks for trailing whitespace and prevents the commit if any is found. This is just one example of how Git hooks can be used to improve code quality and security.
