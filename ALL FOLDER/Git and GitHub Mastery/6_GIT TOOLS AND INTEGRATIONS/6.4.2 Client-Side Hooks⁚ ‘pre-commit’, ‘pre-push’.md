Client-side Git hooks are scripts that run locally on your machine before certain Git actions occur. They provide a powerful way to automate tasks, enforce coding standards, and prevent common mistakes before they are shared with others. Two of the most commonly used client-side hooks are `pre-commit` and `pre-push`. These hooks reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository.

The `pre-commit` hook executes before a commit is created. It's ideal for tasks like running linters, formatters, or unit tests to ensure code quality. For example, you could configure a `pre-commit` hook to automatically run `eslint` on your JavaScript files and prevent the commit if any linting errors are found. The `pre-push` hook, on the other hand, runs just before you push your commits to a remote repository. This hook can be used to perform more extensive tests or checks, such as verifying that all tests pass or preventing the push of commits containing sensitive information.

Here's a simple example of a `pre-commit` hook (written in bash) that prevents commits with the word "TODO" in them:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | grep -q '\.txt$'; then
  if git diff --cached | grep -q 'TODO'; then
    echo "Error: Commit contains 'TODO'. Please remove before committing."
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

This script checks if any `.txt` files are being committed and if they contain the word "TODO". If both conditions are true, the commit is aborted.
