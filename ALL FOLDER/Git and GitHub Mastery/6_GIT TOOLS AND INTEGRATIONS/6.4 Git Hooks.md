Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are a powerful way to automate and customize your Git workflow. By leveraging hooks, you can enforce coding standards, run tests, validate commit messages, and much more, ensuring a consistent and high-quality codebase. Hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory of your Git repository.

These scripts can be written in any scripting language, such as Bash, Python, or Ruby, as long as they are executable. Git hooks are local to each repository, meaning they are not automatically shared when you clone a repository. This allows for flexibility in tailoring hooks to specific project needs. However, it also means you need a mechanism to distribute and manage hooks across your team, such as storing them in a separate directory and using symbolic links or a dedicated hook management tool.

For example, a `pre-commit` hook could run linters and formatters to ensure code style consistency before allowing a commit. Another common example is a `pre-push` hook that runs unit tests to prevent pushing broken code to a remote repository.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# pre-commit hook to run linters

echo "Running linters..."
# Add your linting commands here
echo "Linters passed!"
exit 0
```
