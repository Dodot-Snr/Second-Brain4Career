Git hooks are powerful scripts that Git executes automatically before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. While Git provides a set of standard hooks, the real magic happens when you create your own custom hooks. This allows you to enforce custom policies, automate tasks, and tailor your Git workflow to your specific needs. Custom hooks can be written in any scripting language, such as Bash, Python, or Ruby, as long as they are executable.

Creating custom hooks involves placing executable scripts in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository. The name of the script determines when it will be triggered. For example, a script named `pre-commit` will run before each commit. If the script exits with a non-zero status, the Git operation is aborted. This allows you to prevent commits that don't meet your standards.

A common example is a `pre-commit` hook that checks for trailing whitespace:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if git diff --cached --check --exit-code; then
  echo "No trailing whitespace detected."
else
  echo "Trailing whitespace detected. Aborting commit."
  exit 1
fi
```

Another example is a `commit-msg` hook that validates the commit message format:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import re

commit_msg_file = sys.argv[1]

with open(commit_msg_file, 'r') as f:
    commit_msg = f.read()

if not re.match(r'^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\([a-z]+\))?:\s.+', commit_msg):
    print("Commit message does not follow conventional commits format.")
    sys.exit(1)
```
