Documenting team workflows is crucial for maintaining consistency, onboarding new members, and ensuring everyone understands the agreed-upon processes for using Git and GitHub. This documentation serves as a central source of truth, reducing ambiguity and promoting collaboration. It outlines how the team manages branches, pull requests, code reviews, and releases. Without clear documentation, teams can easily fall into inconsistent practices, leading to merge conflicts, integration issues, and slower development cycles.

Effective documentation should cover the team's branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based Development), detailing the purpose of each branch type (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`) and the rules for merging between them. It should also outline the pull request process, including required reviewers, checklist items for code quality and testing, and guidelines for addressing feedback. For example, a team might document that all pull requests must have at least two approvals and pass all automated tests before being merged into the `develop` branch.

Another key example is documenting the team's commit message conventions. A standardized format, such as using prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, and `refactor:` followed by a concise description, helps maintain a clean and informative commit history. This allows for easier tracking of changes, automated release note generation, and improved code understanding. A documented workflow ensures everyone is on the same page, leading to a more efficient and collaborative development process.
