Onboarding new team members effectively requires providing them with the necessary tools and access to collaborate on projects. A crucial step in this process is setting up their Git and GitHub accounts. This ensures they can contribute to the codebase, track changes, and participate in code reviews. A well-defined process for account creation and initial configuration streamlines the onboarding experience and minimizes potential roadblocks.

This topic covers the essential steps for setting up new team members with Git and GitHub. This includes guiding them through creating a GitHub account (if they don't already have one), setting up SSH keys for secure authentication, configuring their local Git environment with their name and email, and granting them appropriate access to the team's repositories. For example, you might need to add them to specific teams within your GitHub organization to grant them read/write access to certain repositories. Another example is ensuring they understand how to configure their `.gitconfig` file with their user information:

```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"
```

By following a standardized process, you can ensure that all new team members are properly equipped to contribute to your projects from day one.
