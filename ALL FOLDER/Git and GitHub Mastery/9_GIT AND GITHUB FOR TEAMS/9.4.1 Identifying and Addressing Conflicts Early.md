One of the best strategies for conflict resolution in Git is to avoid them in the first place, or at least catch them early. This involves frequent integration of changes from the main branch (usually `main` or `develop`) into your feature branch. By regularly pulling the latest changes, you minimize the divergence between your branch and the main branch, reducing the likelihood of significant conflicts when you eventually merge. This proactive approach allows you to address small, manageable conflicts as they arise, rather than facing a large, complex conflict at the end of your development cycle.

For example, imagine you're working on a feature branch called `feature/new-button`. Instead of working on it for a week without integrating, pull changes from `main` daily using `git pull origin main`. If someone else modified the same file you're working on, you'll encounter a conflict sooner rather than later. This allows you to resolve the conflict while the changes are still fresh in your mind and before your feature branch diverges too far. Another example is using `git fetch` followed by `git rebase origin/main`. This will replay your commits on top of the latest `main` branch, potentially surfacing conflicts in a controlled manner. Addressing these conflicts early makes the final merge process much smoother and less prone to errors.
