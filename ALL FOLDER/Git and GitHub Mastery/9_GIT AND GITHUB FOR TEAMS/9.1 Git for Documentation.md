Documentation is a living, breathing entity that requires version control just as much as code. Git provides a robust system for managing changes to documentation, enabling collaboration, tracking history, and ensuring consistency. Using Git for documentation allows multiple writers to work simultaneously on different sections, review each other's contributions, and easily revert to previous versions if needed. This is especially crucial for large projects with extensive documentation that needs to stay synchronized with code updates.

One key example is using Git to manage documentation written in Markdown. Each change to a Markdown file can be tracked, reviewed, and merged, ensuring that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the software. Another example is using Git to manage documentation websites built with static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo. The entire website source code, including content, templates, and configurations, can be version controlled, allowing for easy deployment and rollback of website updates.
