Testing standards are crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring that your team delivers reliable software. Within the broader context of team standards, establishing clear testing guidelines helps to prevent bugs, streamline the development process, and improve collaboration. This involves defining what types of tests are required (unit, integration, end-to-end), how tests should be written, and when they should be executed (e.g., before each commit, as part of a CI/CD pipeline).

A key aspect of testing standards is defining a consistent approach to test naming and organization. For example, you might require that all unit tests follow the naming convention `Test[FunctionName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]`. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each test and quickly identify failures. Another example is mandating a minimum code coverage percentage (e.g., 80%) to ensure that a significant portion of the codebase is adequately tested.

```python
# Example: Unit test naming convention
def add(x, y):
  return x + y

def test_add_positive_numbers_returns_correct_sum():
  assert add(2, 3) == 5

def test_add_negative_numbers_returns_correct_sum():
  assert add(-2, -3) == -5
```

By establishing and adhering to these standards, teams can build more robust and maintainable software, reducing the risk of introducing errors and improving overall development efficiency.
