Documenting your conflict resolution processes in Git and GitHub is crucial for team collaboration and knowledge sharing. It ensures that everyone understands how conflicts are handled, promoting consistency and reducing future confusion. This documentation should outline the steps taken to identify, analyze, and resolve merge conflicts, as well as any specific tools or techniques used. By having a clear record, teams can learn from past conflicts and improve their workflow.

A good example of documenting a conflict resolution process is creating a dedicated "Conflict Resolution Guide" in your repository's `docs/` directory. This guide could detail the preferred merge tool (e.g., VS Code's built-in merge editor), the team's branching strategy, and specific instructions for resolving common conflict scenarios. Another example is including detailed comments in the commit message of a merge commit that resolved a complex conflict, explaining the rationale behind the chosen resolution.

```
Merge commit resolving conflict in feature/new-feature

Resolved conflict in src/App.js by incorporating changes from both branches.
Kept the new API endpoint from feature/new-feature as it aligns with the latest design.
Reverted the styling changes from main as they introduced visual regressions.
See Conflict Resolution Guide in docs/ for more details.
