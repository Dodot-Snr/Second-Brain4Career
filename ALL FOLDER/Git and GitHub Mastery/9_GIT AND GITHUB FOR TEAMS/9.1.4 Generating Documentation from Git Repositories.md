Git repositories aren't just for code! They can also house your project's documentation. But how do you transform those Markdown files, READMEs, and other text-based documents into a polished, user-friendly website or PDF? This section explores techniques for automatically generating documentation directly from your Git repository, ensuring your documentation stays synchronized with your code.

Several tools and approaches can help. Static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, and MkDocs are popular choices. These tools parse your documentation files (often written in Markdown), apply a theme, and generate static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be easily hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify. By integrating these tools into your CI/CD pipeline, you can automatically rebuild and deploy your documentation whenever changes are pushed to your Git repository.

For example, you might use MkDocs with a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file to define your site's structure and theme. Running `mkdocs build` would then generate the static site. Another common approach is to use a tool like Doxygen, particularly for code-based documentation. Doxygen can parse your code comments and generate API documentation in various formats, including HTML and LaTeX. This ensures your API documentation is always up-to-date with the latest code changes.
