Deploying documentation effectively is crucial for making it accessible to your audience. Git, combined with platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, provides a streamlined workflow for publishing and updating your documentation. This approach leverages version control to ensure consistency and allows for easy rollback to previous versions if needed.

One common method is using GitHub Pages. By pushing your documentation (typically built using tools like Sphinx or MkDocs) to a specific branch (often `gh-pages` or `docs`) on your GitHub repository, GitHub automatically hosts your documentation as a website. Another popular option is using Netlify, which can be configured to automatically deploy your documentation whenever changes are pushed to your Git repository. This continuous deployment approach ensures that your documentation is always up-to-date with the latest code changes.

For example, if you're using MkDocs, you can configure a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to automatically build and deploy your documentation to GitLab Pages whenever you push changes to your `main` branch:

```yaml
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
    - mkdocs build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

This snippet shows how to automate the build and deployment process, making documentation updates seamless.
