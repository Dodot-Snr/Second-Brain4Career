Conflicts are inevitable when multiple developers work on the same project using Git. They arise when changes made in different branches overlap and Git cannot automatically merge them. Understanding how to effectively resolve these conflicts is crucial for maintaining a smooth and collaborative workflow. This section will cover common strategies for identifying, understanding, and resolving merge conflicts.

The most common scenario involves editing the same line in the same file in different branches. Git will mark the conflicting section with special markers: `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> branch_name`. Your task is to examine the conflicting code, understand the changes made in each branch, and decide how to combine them. You then edit the file, removing the conflict markers and leaving behind the desired code.

For example, imagine two developers working on a `README.md` file. One developer adds a new feature description in their branch, while another developer updates the installation instructions in their branch, both modifying the same paragraph. When merging these branches, a conflict will occur. Resolving it requires carefully reviewing both sets of changes and deciding how to integrate the new feature description with the updated installation instructions, potentially rewriting the paragraph to accommodate both.
