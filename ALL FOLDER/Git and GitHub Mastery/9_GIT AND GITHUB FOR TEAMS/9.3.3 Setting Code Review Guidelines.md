Code review guidelines are crucial for maintaining code quality, knowledge sharing, and consistency within a team. They establish a shared understanding of what constitutes good code and how reviews should be conducted. Without clear guidelines, code reviews can become subjective, inconsistent, and even contentious, hindering rather than helping the development process. By defining expectations upfront, teams can ensure that reviews are focused, efficient, and contribute to a healthier codebase.

Effective code review guidelines should cover aspects like code style, error handling, test coverage, and security considerations. For example, a guideline might specify that all new code must have at least 80% test coverage to ensure robustness. Another example could be a rule stating that all public methods must have comprehensive Javadoc-style comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. These guidelines should be documented and easily accessible to all team members, serving as a reference point for both reviewers and authors.
