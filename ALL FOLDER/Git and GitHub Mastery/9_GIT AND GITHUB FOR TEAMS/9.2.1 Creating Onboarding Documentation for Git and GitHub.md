Onboarding new team members to Git and GitHub effectively is crucial for maintaining code quality, ensuring smooth collaboration, and accelerating their productivity. Well-crafted documentation serves as a central resource, guiding newcomers through the essential concepts, workflows, and best practices specific to your team's Git and GitHub usage. This documentation should cover everything from basic Git commands to your team's branching strategy and pull request process.

The documentation should be tailored to your team's specific needs and workflows. For example, if your team uses a specific branching model like Gitflow, the documentation should clearly explain the purpose of each branch (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature`) and the process for creating and merging branches. Another key example is documenting your team's code review process, including expectations for reviewers and submitters, and any specific tools or linters used. Providing clear examples and step-by-step instructions will empower new team members to quickly become proficient with Git and GitHub within your team's context.

## Example: Creating a Feature Branch

1.  Ensure you are on the `develop` branch: `git checkout develop`
2.  Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
3.  Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages.
4.  Push your branch to the remote repository: `git push origin feature/new-feature`
5.  Create a pull request targeting the `develop` branch.
