When using Git for documentation, adopting best practices ensures clarity, collaboration, and maintainability. Documentation projects often involve multiple contributors, frequent updates, and the need to track changes meticulously. Therefore, a well-defined Git workflow is crucial. This includes using descriptive commit messages, branching strategies tailored for documentation (like feature branches for new content or bug fixes), and leveraging pull requests for review and feedback.

One key example is using semantic versioning for documentation releases. Tagging your documentation repository with version numbers (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`) allows users to access documentation specific to the software version they are using. Another example is using a `.gitignore` file to exclude build artifacts or temporary files generated during the documentation build process, keeping the repository clean and focused on the source documentation files. For instance:

```
*.log
/build/
```

By adhering to these best practices, documentation teams can streamline their workflow, improve collaboration, and ensure the accuracy and accessibility of their documentation.
