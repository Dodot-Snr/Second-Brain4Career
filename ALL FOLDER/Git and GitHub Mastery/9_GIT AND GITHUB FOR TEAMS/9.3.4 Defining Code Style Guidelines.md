Consistent code style is crucial for team collaboration and code maintainability. Defining and adhering to code style guidelines ensures that everyone on the team writes code in a similar manner, making it easier to read, understand, and debug. This reduces cognitive load, minimizes merge conflicts, and ultimately speeds up development. Code style guidelines should cover aspects like indentation, naming conventions, commenting, line length, and the use of whitespace.

These guidelines should be documented and readily accessible to all team members. Tools like linters and formatters can be integrated into the development workflow to automatically enforce these rules, reducing the need for manual code reviews focused solely on style. For example, a Python project might enforce a maximum line length of 79 characters using a tool like `flake8` or `black`. Similarly, a JavaScript project might use `ESLint` to enforce consistent use of semicolons and variable declarations.

For example, a naming convention might dictate that all variables should be in camelCase (e.g., `myVariableName`) and all constants should be in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_USERS`). Another example is requiring docstrings for all functions and classes, following a specific format like Google style or NumPy style.

```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    """
    Calculates the area of a rectangle.

    Args:
        length (float): The length of the rectangle.
        width (float): The width of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the rectangle.
    """
    return length * width
```
