Effectively monitoring the progress of new team members during their Git and GitHub onboarding is crucial for ensuring they are grasping the fundamentals and contributing effectively. This involves setting clear expectations, providing regular feedback, and tracking their activities within the Git and GitHub environment. The goal is to identify any roadblocks early on and provide targeted support to accelerate their learning curve.

One key example of monitoring progress is reviewing their pull requests. Are they following established coding standards? Are their commits well-documented and atomic? Are they engaging in constructive code reviews with other team members? Another example is observing their participation in team discussions related to Git workflows and branching strategies. Are they asking questions? Are they contributing to problem-solving? Tools like GitHub's Insights tab can also provide valuable data on their commit frequency and pull request activity, offering a quantitative view of their engagement.
