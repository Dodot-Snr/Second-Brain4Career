Mentorship is a crucial component of successful onboarding, especially when dealing with complex tools like Git and GitHub. Assigning a dedicated mentor to each new team member provides personalized guidance, accelerates their learning curve, and fosters a sense of belonging within the team. A mentor can answer specific questions, provide context on existing workflows, and offer support as the new team member navigates the intricacies of version control. This proactive approach significantly reduces the time it takes for new hires to become productive and confident contributors.

A good mentor can help a new team member understand the team's branching strategy, explain the purpose of specific Git hooks, or walk them through resolving a merge conflict. For example, a mentor might demonstrate how to use `git rebase` to clean up a feature branch before submitting a pull request, or explain the team's code review process on GitHub. By providing real-world examples and hands-on assistance, mentors empower new team members to quickly grasp the practical applications of Git and GitHub within the team's specific context.
