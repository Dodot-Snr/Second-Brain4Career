Documentation, like code, evolves over time. Using Git for version control allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate effectively on documentation projects. This ensures that your documentation remains accurate, consistent, and accessible throughout the lifecycle of your project. By treating documentation as code, you can leverage the full power of Git's branching, merging, and history tracking capabilities.

One key benefit is the ability to create branches for different versions of your documentation. For example, you might have a `v1.0` branch that reflects the documentation for version 1.0 of your software, while simultaneously working on a `develop` branch for the next release. This allows users to access the correct documentation for the version they are using. Another example is using Git to track changes to a README file. Every edit, addition, or deletion is recorded, allowing you to easily see who made what changes and when.

```markdown
# Example: Viewing the history of a README.md file
git log README.md
```

This command will show you a chronological list of commits that have modified the `README.md` file, along with the commit message, author, and date. This detailed history is invaluable for understanding the evolution of your documentation and troubleshooting any issues.
