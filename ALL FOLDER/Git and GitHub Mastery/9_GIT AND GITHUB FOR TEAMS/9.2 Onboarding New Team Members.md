Successfully onboarding new team members to Git and GitHub is crucial for maintaining code quality, ensuring smooth collaboration, and fostering a positive team environment. This process involves providing the necessary access, setting up their local environment, and guiding them through the team's Git workflow. A well-structured onboarding process reduces the learning curve and allows new members to contribute effectively from day one.

A key aspect of onboarding is granting appropriate permissions to the team's repositories. For example, you might use GitHub's team features to grant "read" access to all repositories and "write" access to specific repositories they'll be actively working on. Another important step is guiding them through setting up their local Git environment, including configuring their username and email. This can be achieved by providing a simple script or a step-by-step guide.

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"
```

Finally, introduce them to the team's branching strategy, code review process, and any specific Git conventions used within the project. This ensures consistency and helps prevent common mistakes.
