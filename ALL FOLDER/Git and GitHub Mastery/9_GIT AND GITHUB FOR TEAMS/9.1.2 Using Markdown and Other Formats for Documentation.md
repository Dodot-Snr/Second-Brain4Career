Git excels at version controlling text-based files, making it ideal for managing documentation. While plain text is an option, using markup languages like Markdown significantly enhances readability and maintainability. Markdown allows you to format text with headings, lists, links, and more, all while remaining easily readable in its raw form. This makes it perfect for creating documentation that can be rendered into various formats like HTML, PDF, or even ebooks.

Beyond Markdown, other formats like reStructuredText (often used with Sphinx for Python documentation) and even lightweight formats like AsciiDoc can be version controlled with Git. The key is choosing a format that balances readability, functionality, and the needs of your project. For example, a simple README file might be perfectly suited for Markdown, while a complex API documentation project might benefit from the more advanced features of reStructuredText.

Consider these examples: A project's `README.md` file, written in Markdown, provides a quick overview and instructions. Alternatively, a software library might use reStructuredText and Sphinx to generate comprehensive HTML documentation hosted online.

```python
# Example of a simple Python docstring that can be extracted and formatted
def add(x, y):
    """Adds two numbers together.

    :param x: The first number.
    :param y: The second number.
    :return: The sum of x and y.
    """
    return x + y
```
