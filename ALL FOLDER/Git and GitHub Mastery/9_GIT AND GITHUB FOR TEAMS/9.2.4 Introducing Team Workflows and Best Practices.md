This section focuses on equipping new team members with the knowledge of established Git and GitHub workflows and best practices. Understanding these processes is crucial for seamless collaboration, preventing conflicts, and maintaining a clean and organized codebase. We'll cover common branching strategies, code review processes, and guidelines for writing effective commit messages. By adhering to these standards, new team members can quickly integrate into the team's development cycle and contribute effectively.

A key example we'll explore is the "Gitflow" workflow, a popular branching model that utilizes feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches to manage different stages of development. Another important aspect is understanding the team's code review process. For instance, the team might require at least two approvals on a pull request before it can be merged into the main branch. This ensures that code changes are thoroughly reviewed and meet the team's quality standards. We will also cover how to write good commit messages, following the conventional commits specification.
