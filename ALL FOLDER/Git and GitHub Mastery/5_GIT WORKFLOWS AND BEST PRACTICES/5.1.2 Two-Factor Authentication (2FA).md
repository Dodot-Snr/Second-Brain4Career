Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your GitHub account beyond just your password. It requires you to provide two different authentication factors to verify your identity when you log in. The first factor is something you know (your password), and the second factor is something you have (like a code from your phone or a security key). This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gain access to your account, even if they manage to steal your password.

GitHub supports several 2FA methods. The most common is using a Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) application on your smartphone, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator. These apps generate a new, unique code every 30 seconds. Another option is using a security key, like a YubiKey, which you physically plug into your computer to verify your identity. Enabling 2FA is highly recommended to protect your code, personal information, and contributions on GitHub.
