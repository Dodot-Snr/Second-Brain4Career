Code scanning is a powerful feature within GitHub that allows you to analyze the code in your repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. It uses static analysis, meaning it examines the code without actually executing it. This proactive approach helps identify potential problems early in the development lifecycle, preventing them from becoming larger issues in production. Code scanning can be configured to run automatically on every commit, pull request, or on a scheduled basis, providing continuous security monitoring.

The process involves scanning your codebase with various analysis tools, often referred to as "scanners." These scanners look for patterns and known vulnerabilities based on a set of rules. For example, a scanner might identify a potential SQL injection vulnerability if it detects unsanitized user input being directly used in a database query. Another example could be flagging the use of a deprecated function that is known to have security flaws. The results of these scans are then presented within GitHub, allowing developers to review and address the identified issues.

By integrating code scanning into your workflow, you can significantly improve the security posture of your projects and reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. This helps ensure that your code is not only functional but also secure and reliable.
