Large, monolithic commits are the bane of effective code review. They make it difficult to understand the purpose of the changes, identify potential bugs, and provide meaningful feedback. Breaking down large changes into smaller, logical commits significantly improves the code review process and overall code quality. Each commit should represent a single, focused change, making it easier to understand the "what" and "why" behind the modifications.

Think of each commit as a mini-story. Instead of one long, rambling novel, you're presenting a series of concise, well-defined chapters. For example, instead of a single commit that refactors a function, adds a new feature, and fixes a bug, you would create three separate commits: one for the refactoring, one for the new feature, and one for the bug fix. This allows reviewers to focus on each change independently and provide more targeted feedback. Another example would be separating changes to the UI from changes to the backend logic, even if they are related to the same feature.

Smaller commits also make it easier to revert changes if necessary. If a bug is introduced, it's much simpler to identify and revert a small, focused commit than to unravel a large, complex one. This granular approach to version control promotes a more agile and resilient development workflow.
