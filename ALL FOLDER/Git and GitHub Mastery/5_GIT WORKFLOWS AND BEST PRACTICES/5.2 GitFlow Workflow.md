Gitflow is a branching model designed around project releases. It provides a robust framework for managing larger projects with scheduled release cycles. The core idea revolves around using separate branches for features, releases, and hotfixes, alongside a `main` branch (often called `master` or `main`) that always reflects production-ready code and a `develop` branch that integrates features.

The workflow typically involves creating feature branches off `develop` for individual features. Once a feature is complete, it's merged back into `develop`. When it's time for a release, a release branch is created from `develop`. This allows for final bug fixes and adjustments before merging into both `main` (tagged with the release version) and `develop`. Hotfix branches are created directly from `main` to address critical production bugs. Once fixed, they are merged back into both `main` and `develop` to ensure the fix is incorporated into future releases.

For example, imagine you're developing a new e-commerce website. You might create a `feature/add-payment-gateway` branch to implement the payment processing functionality. After testing and review, this branch would be merged into `develop`. Later, when preparing for the 1.0 release, a `release/1.0` branch would be created from `develop`. Any last-minute bug fixes would be committed to this release branch. Finally, `release/1.0` would be merged into both `main` and `develop`, and `main` would be tagged as `v1.0`.
