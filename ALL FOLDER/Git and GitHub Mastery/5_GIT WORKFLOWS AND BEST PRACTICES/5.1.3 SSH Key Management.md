SSH (Secure Shell) keys provide a more secure way to authenticate with GitHub compared to using passwords. Instead of typing your password every time you interact with GitHub, you use a private key stored on your local machine to prove your identity. This method relies on cryptographic key pairs: a private key that you keep secret and a public key that you upload to your GitHub account. When you try to connect to GitHub, your computer uses the private key to create a digital signature, which GitHub verifies using the corresponding public key.

Managing your SSH keys effectively is crucial for maintaining the security of your GitHub account and repositories. This includes generating strong key pairs, securely storing your private key (often using a passphrase), and regularly reviewing and rotating your keys. For example, if you suspect your private key has been compromised, you should immediately revoke the corresponding public key from your GitHub account and generate a new key pair.

Here's a basic example of generating an SSH key using `ssh-keygen`:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This command generates a new ed25519 key pair, which is a modern and secure algorithm. You would then add the public key (usually located at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) to your GitHub account settings.
