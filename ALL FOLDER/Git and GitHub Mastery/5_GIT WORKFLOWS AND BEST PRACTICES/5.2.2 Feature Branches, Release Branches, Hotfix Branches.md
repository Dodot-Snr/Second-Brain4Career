Gitflow Workflow relies heavily on branching to manage development, releases, and hotfixes. Feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches are the core branch types that enable parallel development, stable releases, and quick fixes in a collaborative environment. Understanding their purpose and usage is crucial for effective Gitflow implementation.

**Feature branches** are used for developing new features. They branch off from the `develop` branch and are merged back into `develop` when the feature is complete. This allows multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other. For example, a developer might create a branch named `feature/user-authentication` to implement user login functionality. Once the feature is tested and approved, it's merged back into the `develop` branch.

**Release branches** are created from the `develop` branch when the team is ready to prepare a new release. They allow for final bug fixes and metadata updates before the release is tagged and merged into both `main` (or `master`) and `develop`. This ensures that the `develop` branch remains open for new feature development while the release is being finalized. For example, a release branch named `release/1.2.0` might be created to prepare version 1.2.0 for deployment.

**Hotfix branches** are used to quickly address critical bugs in the production environment. They branch off directly from the `main` (or `master`) branch, are fixed, and then merged back into both `main` (or `master`) and `develop` (or `release` branch if one exists). This ensures that the bug fix is immediately deployed to production and also integrated into the ongoing development. For example, if a critical security vulnerability is discovered in version 1.1.0, a hotfix branch named `hotfix/1.1.1` would be created from the `main` branch tagged with `1.1.0`, the fix would be implemented, and then the branch would be merged back into `main` (tagged as `1.1.1`) and `develop`.
