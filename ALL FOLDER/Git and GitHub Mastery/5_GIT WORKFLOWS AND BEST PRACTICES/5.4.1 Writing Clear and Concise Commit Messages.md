Clear and concise commit messages are crucial for effective code review and maintaining a healthy project history. They provide context for changes, making it easier for reviewers to understand the purpose and impact of the code. A well-written commit message acts as documentation, helping developers understand the evolution of the codebase and debug issues in the future. Poorly written or absent commit messages can lead to confusion, wasted time, and difficulty in tracking down the origins of bugs or features.

A good commit message typically follows a specific structure. The first line should be a concise summary of the change (ideally under 50 characters), followed by a blank line, and then a more detailed explanation if necessary. The summary should be written in the imperative mood, as if you are giving a command (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug"). The body of the message can provide additional context, explain the reasoning behind the changes, and reference relevant issues or pull requests.

For example, consider these two commit messages:

**Bad:**

```
Fixed it
```

**Good:**

```
Fix: Prevent null pointer exception in user authentication

This commit addresses a potential null pointer exception that could occur during user authentication when the user object is not properly initialized. Added a null check to ensure that the authentication process handles cases where the user object is null, preventing the application from crashing. Resolves issue #123.
```

The "good" example clearly explains what was fixed, why it was fixed, and references the relevant issue. This makes it much easier for reviewers to understand the change and for future developers to understand the history of the code.
