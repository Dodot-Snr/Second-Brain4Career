Secret scanning is a security feature offered by GitHub that automatically detects secrets, such as API keys, tokens, and credentials, that have been accidentally committed to a repository. It helps prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches by identifying and alerting users to exposed secrets. This proactive approach allows developers to quickly revoke compromised credentials and prevent malicious actors from exploiting them.

GitHub's secret scanning works by continuously scanning repositories for known patterns and signatures associated with various secret types. When a secret is detected, GitHub notifies the repository owner and, in some cases, the service provider associated with the secret. For example, if an AWS access key is detected, GitHub might notify both the repository owner and Amazon Web Services. This allows for immediate action to be taken, such as revoking the compromised key and generating a new one.

Consider a scenario where a developer accidentally commits a file containing their AWS Secret Access Key to a public repository. Secret scanning would detect this key and alert the repository owner. Another example would be accidentally committing a private SSH key. By using secret scanning, GitHub helps developers maintain a secure development environment and prevent sensitive information from being exposed.
