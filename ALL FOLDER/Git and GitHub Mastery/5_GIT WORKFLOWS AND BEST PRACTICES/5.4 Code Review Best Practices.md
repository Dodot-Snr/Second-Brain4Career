Code review is a critical part of the software development lifecycle, especially when using Git and GitHub. It involves having other developers examine your code changes before they are merged into the main codebase. This process helps identify potential bugs, improve code quality, share knowledge, and ensure consistency across the project. Effective code reviews lead to more robust and maintainable software.

A key best practice is to keep code reviews focused and manageable. Large, complex pull requests can be overwhelming and lead to superficial reviews. Instead, break down large changes into smaller, logical units. For example, instead of submitting a pull request that refactors an entire module and adds a new feature, separate the refactoring into one pull request and the new feature into another. Another important aspect is providing constructive and specific feedback. Instead of saying "This code is bad," try "This code could be improved by using a more descriptive variable name, such as `user_age` instead of `age`."

Remember to be respectful and open to feedback during the code review process. The goal is to improve the code and learn from each other.
