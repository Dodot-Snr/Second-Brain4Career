Branching and Pull Requests are core components of the GitHub Flow workflow. Branching allows you to isolate your work on a new feature or bug fix without directly affecting the `main` branch (or `master` in older repositories), which should always represent a stable and deployable version of your code. You create a new branch from `main`, make your changes, and then, when you're ready to integrate those changes, you create a Pull Request (PR).

A Pull Request is essentially a request to merge your branch into `main`. It provides a platform for code review, discussion, and automated checks (like tests) to ensure the quality and stability of the changes. For example, if you're adding a new feature like user authentication, you'd create a branch named `feature/user-authentication`, implement the feature, and then open a PR targeting the `main` branch. Another example would be fixing a bug; you might create a branch named `fix/login-bug`, implement the fix, and then open a PR.

The PR allows collaborators to review your code, suggest changes, and ensure that the new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase. Once the review is complete and any necessary changes are made, the PR can be merged into `main`, incorporating your work into the main codebase. This process ensures a collaborative and controlled approach to software development.
