GitHub Flow, when adopted by a team, requires clear communication and adherence to established conventions to ensure smooth collaboration and prevent conflicts. It's not just about individual developers creating branches and pull requests; it's about a shared understanding of the workflow and its benefits. This includes defining branch naming conventions (e.g., `feature/add-new-button`, `bugfix/resolve-login-issue`), establishing code review processes, and agreeing on when and how to merge changes into the main branch. A well-defined process helps maintain code quality and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.

A key aspect of implementing GitHub Flow in a team is the use of pull requests (PRs) for all code changes. For example, imagine a team working on a web application. A developer working on a new feature creates a branch, `feature/user-profile`, and implements the changes. Before merging this branch into the `main` branch, they create a pull request. Other team members review the code, provide feedback, and suggest improvements. Only after the PR is approved and all checks pass is the code merged. This collaborative review process helps catch potential issues early and ensures that the code meets the team's standards. Another example is using GitHub Actions to automate testing and linting on each pull request, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project.
