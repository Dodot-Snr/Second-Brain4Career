Repository security settings on GitHub provide a crucial layer of protection for your code and collaboration workflows. These settings allow you to control who has access to your repository, what actions they can perform, and how changes are made. Properly configuring these settings is essential for preventing unauthorized access, malicious contributions, and accidental data loss.

Key security settings include branch protection rules, which enforce specific workflows for merging code, such as requiring code reviews or passing status checks. For example, you can configure your `main` branch to require at least two approving reviews before a pull request can be merged. Another important setting is managing collaborators and their permissions. You can grant different levels of access (read, write, or admin) to individuals or teams, ensuring that only authorized personnel can modify the repository's contents or settings.

By carefully configuring repository security settings, you can significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and maintain the integrity of your codebase. For instance, enabling vulnerability alerts will notify you of known security flaws in your dependencies, allowing you to address them promptly.

      required_status_checks:
        strict: true
        contexts: [lint, test]
      enforce_admins: true
      required_pull_request_reviews:
        required_approving_review_count: 2
