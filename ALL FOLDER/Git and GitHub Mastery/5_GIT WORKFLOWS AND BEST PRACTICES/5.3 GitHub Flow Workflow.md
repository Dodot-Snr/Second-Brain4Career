GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that's ideal for teams and projects with frequent deployments. It emphasizes continuous integration and delivery, making it easy to ship code quickly and reliably. The core principle revolves around creating a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or experiment, ensuring that the `main` branch always reflects the deployable state of the project.

The workflow typically involves the following steps: create a branch from `main`, make your changes on that branch, push your branch to GitHub, open a pull request, discuss and review the code, and finally, merge the pull request into `main` after approval. Once merged, the changes are immediately deployed. This streamlined process encourages collaboration and allows for rapid iteration.

For example, if you're adding a new user authentication feature, you'd create a branch named `feature/user-authentication`. After implementing the feature and writing tests, you'd open a pull request. Another developer would review your code, provide feedback, and once approved, the `feature/user-authentication` branch would be merged into `main` and deployed. Similarly, for a bug fix, you might create a branch named `fix/login-error`, implement the fix, and follow the same pull request and merge process.
