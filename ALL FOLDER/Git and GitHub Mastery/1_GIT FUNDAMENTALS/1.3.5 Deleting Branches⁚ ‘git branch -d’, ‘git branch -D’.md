Once a branch has served its purpose and its changes have been merged into another branch (typically `main` or `develop`), it's good practice to delete it to keep your repository clean and organized. Git provides two primary commands for deleting branches: `git branch -d <branch_name>` and `git branch -D <branch_name>`. The lowercase `-d` flag is a "safe" delete, meaning Git will only allow you to delete the branch if it has already been fully merged into the current branch. This prevents accidental data loss.

The uppercase `-D` flag, on the other hand, is a "force" delete. It allows you to delete a branch regardless of its merge status. Use this with caution, as it can lead to losing unmerged work. It's generally recommended to use `-d` first and only use `-D` if you're absolutely sure you want to delete the branch and any unmerged commits it contains.

For example, to delete a branch named `feature/new-login` after merging it into `main`, you would first switch to the `main` branch (`git checkout main`) and then run `git branch -d feature/new-login`. If the branch hasn't been merged, Git will output an error message. To force the deletion, you would use `git branch -D feature/new-login`.

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/new-login # Safe delete
git branch -D feature/new-login # Force delete (use with caution!)
```
