The `git commit` command is the cornerstone of saving your work in Git. It takes the staged changes (those added with `git add`) and creates a snapshot of them in the repository's history. Think of it as saving a version of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID (SHA-1 hash), a timestamp, the author's information, and a descriptive message explaining the changes made. Without commits, your changes exist only in your working directory and are not tracked by Git.

To create a commit, you first stage the desired changes using `git add`. Then, you use `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"`. The `-m` flag allows you to include the commit message directly in the command. A good commit message is crucial for understanding the history of your project. It should be concise but informative, explaining _why_ the changes were made, not just _what_ was changed.

For example, after modifying a file named `README.md` and adding it to the staging area with `git add README.md`, you might commit it with the command:

```bash
git commit -m "Update README with project description and installation instructions"
```

Alternatively, you can use `git commit` without the `-m` flag. This will open a text editor where you can write a more detailed commit message, including a subject line and a body with more context.
