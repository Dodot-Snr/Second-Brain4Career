The `git status` command is your go-to tool for understanding the current state of your working directory and staging area. It provides a snapshot of which files have been modified, which are staged for commit, and which are untracked by Git. Think of it as a quick health check for your repository, allowing you to see what's going on before you commit any changes. Regularly using `git status` helps prevent accidental commits and ensures you're only committing the changes you intend to.

`git status` provides information in different categories. Untracked files are files in your working directory that Git isn't currently tracking. Modified files are those that have been changed since your last commit. Staged files are those that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed. For example, if you modify a file named `my_script.py` and then run `git status`, you'll likely see it listed under "Changes not staged for commit." To stage it, you'd use `git add my_script.py`.

Here's a simple example of how to use `git status` in your terminal:

```bash
git status
```

This command will output information about the state of your repository, including any untracked, modified, or staged files. Understanding this output is crucial for effective Git workflow.
