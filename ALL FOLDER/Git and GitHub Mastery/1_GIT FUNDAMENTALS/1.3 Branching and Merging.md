Branching and merging are fundamental concepts in Git that enable parallel development and collaboration. Branching allows you to diverge from the main line of development (usually the `main` or `master` branch) and work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation. This prevents unstable code from affecting the main codebase. Think of it like creating a separate timeline for your project.

Once the changes on a branch are complete and tested, merging integrates them back into the main branch or another branch. Git offers various merging strategies to handle conflicts that may arise when changes are made to the same lines of code in different branches. A common example is creating a `feature/new-login` branch to develop a new login system. After thorough testing, this branch is merged back into the `main` branch.

Here's a simple example of creating and merging a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature  # Create and switch to a new branch
# Make changes, commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented new feature"
git checkout main                  # Switch back to the main branch
git merge feature/new-feature       # Merge the feature branch into main
git branch -d feature/new-feature  # Delete the feature branch (optional)
```
