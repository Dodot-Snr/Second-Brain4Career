Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Think of it as a "time machine" for your code. It allows you to revert to previous states, compare changes over time, see who modified what, and collaborate more effectively with others. Without version control, managing code, especially in team environments, becomes incredibly difficult and prone to errors.

The primary benefit of version control is its ability to track changes. For example, imagine you're working on a website and accidentally delete a crucial section of code. With version control, you can easily revert to the previous version where that code still existed. Another key advantage is collaboration. Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. Version control systems like Git handle merging these changes, resolving conflicts, and ensuring everyone is working with the latest version of the codebase.

A common example is using version control to track changes to a configuration file. If a change breaks the application, you can quickly revert to the last working version. Another example is when multiple developers are working on different features of the same application. Version control allows them to merge their changes seamlessly, preventing conflicts and ensuring a stable codebase.
