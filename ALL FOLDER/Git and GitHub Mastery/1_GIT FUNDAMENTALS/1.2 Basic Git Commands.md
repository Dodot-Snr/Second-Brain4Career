This section introduces the fundamental Git commands you'll use daily to manage your code. Understanding these commands is crucial for tracking changes, collaborating with others, and maintaining a clean and organized project history. We'll cover commands for initializing repositories, staging changes, committing updates, viewing history, and more. Mastering these basics will provide a solid foundation for more advanced Git workflows.

Key commands include `git init` to create a new Git repository, `git add` to stage changes for commit, `git commit` to save changes with a descriptive message, `git status` to view the state of your working directory, and `git log` to review the commit history. For example, after making changes to a file named `my_file.txt`, you would use `git add my_file.txt` to stage the changes and then `git commit -m "Updated my_file.txt"` to commit them with a message.

Here's a quick example of initializing a repository and making a commit:

```bash
git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added README.md"
```
