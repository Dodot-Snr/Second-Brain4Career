Before you can start using Git for version control, you need to install it on your local machine. The installation process varies depending on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). This section will guide you through the installation process for each of these platforms, ensuring you have Git properly set up and ready to use. We'll cover the most common and recommended methods for installation.

For example, on macOS, the easiest way to install Git is often through Homebrew, a package manager. You would use the command `brew install git` in your terminal. On Windows, you can download the Git installer from the official Git website ([git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com)) and follow the on-screen instructions. The installer provides a user-friendly interface and allows you to customize your Git environment. We will explore these and other methods in detail, including using package managers on Linux distributions like apt and yum.
