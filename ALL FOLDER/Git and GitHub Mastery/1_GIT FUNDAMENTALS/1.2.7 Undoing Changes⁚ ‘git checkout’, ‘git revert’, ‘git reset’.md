This section covers the essential commands for undoing changes in Git: `git checkout`, `git revert`, and `git reset`. Understanding these commands is crucial for managing your project's history and recovering from mistakes. Each command has a different purpose and impact on your repository's history, so choosing the right one is important.

`git checkout` is primarily used for switching branches or restoring files to a previous state. For example, `git checkout -- <file>` will discard local changes to a specific file, reverting it to the version in the staging area or the last commit. `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a specific commit. This is a safe way to undo changes because it preserves the project's history. For example, `git revert <commit-hash>` will create a new commit that reverses the changes made in the commit specified by `<commit-hash>`.

`git reset` is a powerful command that moves the current branch pointer to a previous commit, potentially discarding commits. It has three modes: `--soft`, `--mixed` (default), and `--hard`. `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` is the most destructive, as it discards all changes since the specified commit, both staged and unstaged. Use `git reset` with caution, especially when working on shared branches.
