Version Control Systems (VCS) come in two main flavors: centralized and distributed. Understanding the difference is crucial for appreciating the power and flexibility of Git. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) like Subversion (SVN) rely on a single, central repository where all changes are stored. Developers check out code from this central repository, make their changes, and then commit those changes back to the central repository. This model works well for smaller teams and simpler projects, but it has some drawbacks. If the central server goes down, no one can collaborate or access the project's history.

Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS), like Git, offer a more robust and flexible approach. In a DVCS, every developer has a complete copy of the entire repository, including the full history. This means that developers can work offline, commit changes locally, and experiment without affecting the central repository. When they're ready, they can push their changes to a central repository (like GitHub) or share them directly with other developers. This distributed nature provides redundancy, increased speed, and greater flexibility in workflows. For example, if the central server in a Git-based project fails, developers can continue working and collaborating using their local repositories, and a new central repository can be easily created from any of the existing local copies.
