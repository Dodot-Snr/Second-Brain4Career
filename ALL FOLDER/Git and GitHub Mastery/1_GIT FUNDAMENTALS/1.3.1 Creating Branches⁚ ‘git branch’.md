Branching is a fundamental concept in Git, allowing you to diverge from the main line of development (usually `main` or `master`) and work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation. The `git branch` command is your primary tool for creating, listing, and deleting branches. Creating a branch doesn't affect the original branch; it simply creates a new pointer to a specific commit. This allows you to make changes without risking the stability of your main codebase.

To create a new branch, you use the command `git branch <branch_name>`. For example, to create a branch named `feature/new-login`, you would run `git branch feature/new-login`. This creates the branch, but you are still on your original branch (e.g., `main`). To switch to the new branch and start working on it, you need to use the `git checkout` command (covered in the next section).

Here's a quick example:

```bash
git branch feature/new-login
git branch  # Lists all branches, with the current branch highlighted
```

This sequence first creates a new branch called `feature/new-login`. The second command, `git branch`, lists all available branches in your repository. The currently active branch will be indicated with an asterisk (*) and highlighted in green (depending on your terminal configuration).
