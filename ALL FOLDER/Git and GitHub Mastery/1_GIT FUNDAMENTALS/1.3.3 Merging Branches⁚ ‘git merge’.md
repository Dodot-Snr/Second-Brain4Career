Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. The `git merge` command is the primary tool for this. It takes the changes from a specified branch (the source branch) and applies them to the currently checked-out branch (the target branch). This allows you to combine features, bug fixes, or any other modifications made in separate branches into a single, unified codebase.

For example, imagine you have a `feature/new-button` branch where you've developed a new button for your website. To incorporate this new button into your main development branch (typically `main` or `develop`), you would first checkout the target branch and then merge the feature branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-button
```

This command attempts to automatically integrate the changes. If Git encounters conflicting changes (i.e., the same lines of code were modified differently in both branches), it will mark the conflicts in the affected files, requiring you to manually resolve them before completing the merge. After resolving conflicts, you stage the changes and commit to finalize the merge.
