The `git log` command is your window into the past, allowing you to view the commit history of your repository. It displays a chronological list of commits, including information like the author, date, commit message, and a unique SHA-1 hash (the commit ID). Understanding how to navigate and filter this history is crucial for understanding project evolution, debugging, and collaborating effectively.

By default, `git log` shows the commit history in reverse chronological order (newest first). Each commit entry provides valuable context. For example, running `git log` will display a detailed history. You can also use flags to customize the output. For instance, `git log --oneline` provides a condensed view, showing only the commit hash and message on a single line, making it easier to scan through the history quickly.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Another useful option is `git log -n <number>`, which limits the output to the specified number of commits. For example, `git log -n 3` will show only the three most recent commits. These are just a few of the many options available to tailor the `git log` output to your specific needs.
