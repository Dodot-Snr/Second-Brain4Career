The `git add` command is a fundamental part of the Git workflow. It's used to stage changes, meaning you're telling Git that you want to include specific modifications in your next commit. Think of the staging area as a preparation zone where you gather all the changes you want to bundle together into a meaningful commit. Without staging, your changes won't be included in the commit history.

`git add` is versatile. You can add individual files, entire directories, or even use patterns to stage multiple files at once. It's important to note that `git add` doesn't actually record the changes in the repository's history; it only prepares them for the next commit.

For example, to stage a single file named `my_file.txt`, you would use:

```bash
git add my_file.txt
```

To stage all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can use:

```bash
git add .
```
