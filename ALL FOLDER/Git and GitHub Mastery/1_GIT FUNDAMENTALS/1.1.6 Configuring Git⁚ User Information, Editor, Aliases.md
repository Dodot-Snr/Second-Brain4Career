Before diving into version control, it's crucial to configure Git with your personal information and preferred tools. This configuration ensures proper attribution for your commits and streamlines your workflow. Setting your user name and email is essential, as Git uses this information to identify you as the author of changes. You can set these globally (for all repositories) or locally (for a specific repository).

Configuring your default text editor is another important step. Git uses this editor for writing commit messages, resolving merge conflicts, and other tasks. Popular choices include VS Code, Sublime Text, and Vim. Finally, Git aliases allow you to create shortcuts for frequently used commands, saving you time and effort. For example, you might create an alias `co` for `git checkout`.

```bash
# Example: Setting a global alias
git config --global alias.co checkout
```

```bash
# Example: Setting your global user name and email
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
