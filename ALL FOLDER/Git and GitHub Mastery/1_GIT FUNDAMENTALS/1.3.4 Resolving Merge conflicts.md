Merge conflicts arise when Git encounters changes on different branches that it cannot automatically reconcile during a merge or rebase operation. This typically happens when the same lines in a file have been modified differently on separate branches. Understanding how to identify and resolve these conflicts is crucial for effective collaboration and maintaining a clean project history.

When a conflict occurs, Git will mark the affected file with special conflict markers. These markers, `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`, delineate the conflicting changes from different branches. Your task is to manually edit the file, choosing which changes to keep, modify, or combine to create a unified version. For example, if you have a conflict in `README.md`, you might see something like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the README on the main branch.
=======
This is the README on the feature branch.
>>>>>>> feature/new-feature
```

To resolve this, you would edit the file, removing the conflict markers and deciding which version of the text to keep. You might choose to keep both, combining them into a single, coherent sentence. After resolving all conflicts in a file, you stage the changes (`git add <file>`) and continue the merge process (`git commit`). Mastering conflict resolution ensures smooth integration of features and prevents data loss.
