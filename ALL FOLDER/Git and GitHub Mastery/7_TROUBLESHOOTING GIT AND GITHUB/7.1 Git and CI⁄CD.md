This section explores how Git integrates with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. CI/CD automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring faster and more reliable software releases. Git plays a crucial role by triggering these pipelines based on events like pushing code to a repository or creating a pull request. By connecting Git workflows with CI/CD, teams can streamline their development process, reduce manual errors, and improve overall software quality.

A common example is using GitHub Actions. When a developer pushes a new commit to a branch, a GitHub Actions workflow can automatically run tests. If the tests pass, the workflow might then build a deployable artifact. Another example is using pull requests. A CI/CD pipeline can be configured to run tests and code analysis on every pull request, providing immediate feedback to the developer and preventing integration issues before merging. This tight integration between Git and CI/CD is essential for modern software development practices.
