Git webhooks are automated HTTP callbacks triggered by specific events in a Git repository, such as pushing code, creating a pull request, or merging branches. They provide a powerful mechanism to integrate your Git repository with other services, most notably CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines. Instead of manually initiating builds and deployments, webhooks enable your CI/CD system to automatically react to code changes, streamlining the development process.

When a relevant event occurs in your Git repository (e.g., a push to the `main` branch), the Git server sends an HTTP POST request to a pre-configured URL. This URL typically points to your CI/CD server. The CI/CD server receives the webhook payload, which contains information about the event (e.g., the branch that was updated, the commit hash, the author). Based on this information, the CI/CD server can then trigger a build, run tests, and deploy the application.

For example, you might configure a webhook to trigger a build on every push to the `develop` branch. Another common use case is to trigger a build and run automated tests whenever a pull request is created or updated. This allows you to catch potential issues early in the development cycle, before the code is merged into the main branch. The configuration of webhooks is typically done through the Git repository's settings (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
