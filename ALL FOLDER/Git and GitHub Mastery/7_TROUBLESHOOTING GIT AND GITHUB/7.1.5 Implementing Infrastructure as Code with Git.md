Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, rather than through manual processes. Integrating Git into your IaC workflow brings version control, collaboration, and auditability to your infrastructure management. By storing your infrastructure configurations (e.g., Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation templates) in Git repositories, you can track changes, revert to previous states, and ensure consistency across your environments. This approach allows you to treat your infrastructure like any other piece of software, applying the same development best practices.

Using Git for IaC enables powerful workflows. For example, you can create feature branches to test infrastructure changes in isolated environments before merging them into the main branch and deploying to production. Code reviews become a crucial part of the infrastructure deployment process, ensuring that changes are vetted by multiple team members. Furthermore, Git's history provides a complete audit trail of all infrastructure modifications, making it easier to diagnose issues and comply with regulatory requirements.

Consider a scenario where you're using Terraform to manage your AWS infrastructure. Your Terraform configuration files, defining resources like EC2 instances and S3 buckets, are stored in a Git repository. Any changes to these files, such as increasing the instance size or adding a new bucket, are committed to Git, triggering a CI/CD pipeline that automatically applies the changes to your AWS environment. This automated process ensures that your infrastructure is always in sync with the code in your Git repository.
