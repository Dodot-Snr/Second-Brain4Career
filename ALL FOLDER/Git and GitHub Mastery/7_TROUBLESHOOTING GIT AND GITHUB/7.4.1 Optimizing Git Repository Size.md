A large Git repository can significantly impact performance, slowing down cloning, fetching, and other Git operations. Optimizing repository size is crucial for maintaining efficiency and a smooth development workflow. This involves identifying and removing unnecessary large files, rewriting history to eliminate unwanted data, and configuring Git to handle large files more effectively.

Several techniques can be employed to reduce repository size. One common approach is to use `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` (a more modern and recommended alternative) to remove large files that were accidentally committed. For example, if you accidentally committed a 1GB video file, you can use `git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 10M` to remove all files larger than 10MB from the repository's history. Another strategy is to leverage Git Large File Storage (LFS) for managing large binary files like images, audio, and video. LFS replaces these files with text pointers in Git, storing the actual file content separately, thus keeping the repository size manageable.
