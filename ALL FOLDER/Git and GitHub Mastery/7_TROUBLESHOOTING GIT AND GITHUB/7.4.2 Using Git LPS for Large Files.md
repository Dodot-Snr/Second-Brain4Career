Git is excellent for tracking changes in text-based files, but it struggles with large binary files like images, audio, videos, and datasets. Storing these directly in your Git repository can lead to performance issues, including slow cloning, fetching, and pushing. Git Large File Storage (LFS) is an extension that replaces large files in your repository with text pointers, while storing the actual file content on a separate server. This keeps your repository lean and efficient, improving overall performance.

Git LFS works by intercepting large files during the commit process. Instead of storing the entire file in the repository, it creates a small text file (the pointer) that references the actual file stored on the LFS server. When you clone or checkout the repository, Git LFS automatically downloads the actual file content based on these pointers. This ensures that you only download the large files you need, rather than the entire history of large files.

For example, if you have a game project with large texture files, you can use Git LFS to manage them. First, you would track the texture files using `git lfs track "*.png"`. Then, when you commit a PNG file, Git LFS will store the actual file on the LFS server and replace it with a pointer in your repository. Another example is managing large datasets for machine learning projects. Using Git LFS ensures that your repository remains manageable and that collaborators can efficiently access the necessary data without downloading the entire dataset history.
