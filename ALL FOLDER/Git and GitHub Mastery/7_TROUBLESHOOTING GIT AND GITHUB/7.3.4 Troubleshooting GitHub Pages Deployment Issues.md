GitHub Pages is a fantastic way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. However, deployment issues can sometimes arise, leaving your site inaccessible. This section will equip you with the knowledge to diagnose and resolve common problems that prevent your GitHub Pages site from deploying correctly. We'll cover issues ranging from incorrect repository settings to problems with your site's build process.

One frequent culprit is an incorrectly configured source branch. For example, if you're using a `docs` folder in your `main` branch, you need to specify this in your repository's GitHub Pages settings under "Source". Another common issue is a misconfigured `CNAME` file if you're using a custom domain. Ensure the `CNAME` file contains only your domain name (e.g., `example.com`) and is placed in the root of your publishing source.

Let's say your site isn't updating after you push changes. First, check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see if the GitHub Pages build workflow is running and completing successfully. If the workflow fails, examine the logs for error messages. These logs often provide clues about the underlying problem, such as missing dependencies or syntax errors in your site's code. For example, if you are using Jekyll, a common error is a dependency issue. You can often resolve this by specifying the correct gems in your `Gemfile` and ensuring they are installed correctly.

```ruby
# Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "jekyll"
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```
