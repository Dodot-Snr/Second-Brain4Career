Git's object database is the heart of how Git stores and manages your project's history. Instead of tracking changes as differences between files, Git uses a content-addressable system. This means every piece of data – files, directories (trees), and commits – is stored as an object, uniquely identified by a SHA-1 hash of its content. This hash acts as the object's address in the database. This approach ensures data integrity and efficient storage, as identical content is only stored once.

The object database lives in the `.git/objects` directory. Inside, you'll find objects organized into subdirectories named after the first two characters of their SHA-1 hash. For example, a file with the hash `e9cb3e5179d374486e1799986594c69569c7319a` would be stored in `.git/objects/e9/cb3e5179d374486e1799986594c69569c7319a`. These objects are typically compressed using zlib to save space.

Git uses four main object types: _blob_ (for file content), _tree_ (for directory structure), _commit_ (for snapshots of the repository), and _tag_ (for marking specific commits). When you add a file to the staging area using `git add`, Git creates a blob object for its content. When you commit, Git creates a tree object representing the directory structure at that point in time, and then a commit object pointing to that tree, along with metadata like author, committer, and commit message. Understanding this structure is crucial for comprehending how Git reconstructs your project's history.
