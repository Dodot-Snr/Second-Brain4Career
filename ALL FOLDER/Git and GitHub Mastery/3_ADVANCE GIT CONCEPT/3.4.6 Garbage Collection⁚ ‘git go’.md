Git's garbage collection, triggered by the `git gc` command, is an essential maintenance process that optimizes your repository's storage and performance. Over time, Git accumulates loose objects (unreferenced commits, files, etc.) due to operations like commits, rebases, and merges. `git gc` cleans up these loose objects, packs them into packfiles for efficient storage, and prunes unreachable objects, ultimately reducing the repository size and improving Git's overall speed. While Git often runs `git gc --auto` periodically, manually running `git gc` can be beneficial, especially after large-scale operations.

Think of it like tidying up your workspace. After a big project (a series of commits and branches), you might have scattered papers (loose objects) everywhere. `git gc` is like gathering those papers, organizing them into folders (packfiles), and throwing away the ones you no longer need (unreachable objects). For example, if you delete a branch that contained several commits, those commits might become unreachable. Running `git gc` will eventually remove them.

A basic execution of garbage collection is as simple as running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git gc
```

This command will perform a standard garbage collection, cleaning up loose objects and optimizing the repository. You can also use the `--aggressive` flag for a more thorough, but potentially slower, cleanup.
