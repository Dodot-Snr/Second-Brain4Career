Understanding Git internals unlocks a deeper appreciation for how Git manages your code and allows you to troubleshoot complex issues more effectively. At its core, Git is a content-addressable filesystem. This means that every piece of data, whether it's a file's content, a commit message, or directory structure, is stored as an object identified by a unique SHA-1 hash of its content. These objects are stored in Git's object database, typically located in the `.git/objects` directory. Git uses these objects to reconstruct your project's history and current state.

Git primarily uses three types of objects: blobs (representing file content), trees (representing directories), and commits (representing snapshots of the repository at a specific point in time). When you add a file to the staging area using `git add`, Git creates a blob object for the file's content and stores it in the object database. A tree object is then created to represent the directory structure, pointing to the blob objects representing the files within that directory. Finally, when you commit, a commit object is created, pointing to the root tree object, the parent commit(s), the author, committer, and commit message.

For example, if you modify a file and commit the changes, Git doesn't store the entire file again. Instead, it creates a new blob object for the modified content and updates the tree and commit objects accordingly. This efficient storage mechanism, combined with Git's branching and merging capabilities, makes it a powerful version control system. Understanding how these objects are linked together allows you to navigate the Git history and understand how changes have been made over time.
