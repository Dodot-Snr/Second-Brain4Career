Interactive rebasing, invoked with `git rebase -i`, is a powerful tool that allows you to rewrite your commit history with surgical precision. Unlike a standard rebase which automatically applies commits, interactive rebasing opens an editor where you can choose which commits to include, reorder them, squash them together, edit their messages, or even drop them entirely. This provides unparalleled control over your branch's history, making it cleaner and more understandable.

The basic syntax is `git rebase -i <commit>`, where `<commit>` is the commit before the first commit you want to modify. Git will then open your configured text editor with a list of commits to be rebased. Each line in the editor represents a commit and starts with a command (e.g., `pick`, `reword`, `edit`, `squash`, `fixup`, `drop`). By changing these commands and reordering the lines, you can manipulate your commit history. For example, you might use `squash` to combine several small commits into a single, more meaningful commit, or `reword` to correct a typo in a commit message.

For instance, if you have three commits you want to rebase, running `git rebase -i HEAD~3` will open an editor. You could then change `pick` to `reword` on the first commit to edit its message, and change `pick` to `squash` on the second commit to merge it into the first. Saving and closing the editor will then initiate the rebase process, prompting you to edit the commit message if you chose `reword` or `squash`. Interactive rebasing is invaluable for preparing a feature branch for merging, ensuring a clean and logical history in the main branch.
