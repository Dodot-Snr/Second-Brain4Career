Git's core functionality relies heavily on a cryptographic hash function called SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1). While Git is migrating away from SHA-1, understanding it is crucial for comprehending Git's internal workings. SHA-1 takes any input (a file's content, a commit's metadata, etc.) and produces a fixed-size 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, typically represented as a 40-character hexadecimal string. This hash acts as a unique fingerprint for that specific data. Any change to the input, no matter how small, will result in a completely different SHA-1 hash.

Git uses these SHA-1 hashes to identify and track every object in its repository: blobs (file content), trees (directory structure), commits (snapshots of the repository), and tags (references to specific commits). For example, if you modify a file and add it to the staging area, Git calculates the SHA-1 hash of the file's content and stores it as a blob object. The commit object then references this blob object's SHA-1 hash, linking the commit to the specific version of the file. This ensures data integrity and allows Git to efficiently track changes over time.

Consider a simple text file named `hello.txt` containing the word "Hello". Git calculates the SHA-1 hash of this content, which might be something like `5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb5dbdc3359d6a5c3`. This hash becomes the unique identifier for that specific version of the `hello.txt` file within the Git repository. If you change the file to "Hello World", the SHA-1 hash will be completely different, reflecting the change in content.
