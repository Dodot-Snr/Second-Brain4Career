GitHub Project Boards provide a visual, flexible way to organize and track your work directly within your repositories. Based on the Kanban methodology, these boards allow you to create customizable columns representing different stages of your workflow (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Completed"). You can then add issues and pull requests as cards to these columns, easily dragging and dropping them as they progress. This provides a clear overview of the project's status and helps teams collaborate effectively.

Project boards are highly customizable. You can create multiple boards within a repository, each tailored to a specific project or workflow. You can also automate certain actions, such as automatically moving an issue to the "In Progress" column when it's assigned to someone. For example, you might create a board for bug fixes, with columns for "Reported," "Triaged," "In Development," "Testing," and "Resolved." Each bug report (issue) would start in "Reported" and move through the columns as it's addressed.

Furthermore, you can link issues and pull requests to specific cards on the board, providing context and traceability. This makes it easy to see the relationship between different tasks and track the progress of individual features or bug fixes. For instance, a pull request that implements a new feature can be linked to a card in the "In Development" column, allowing team members to quickly access the code changes and understand their purpose.
