The `git stash apply` command is used to reapply a previously stashed change to your working directory. Unlike `git stash pop`, which both applies and removes the stash from the stash list, `git stash apply` leaves the stash intact. This is useful when you want to apply the same stash to multiple branches or need to keep the stash around for later use.

By default, `git stash apply` applies the most recently created stash (stash@{0}). However, you can specify a different stash to apply by providing its index. For example, `git stash apply stash@{2}` would apply the third stash in the list. If conflicts arise during the application, Git will leave conflict markers in your files, which you'll need to resolve manually before committing.

For example, if you have a stash named `stash@{1}` that contains changes to `my_file.txt`, running `git stash apply stash@{1}` will attempt to merge those changes into your current working directory's `my_file.txt`. If the merge is successful, your working directory will be updated with the stashed changes. If conflicts occur, you'll need to resolve them, stage the resolved file (`git add my_file.txt`), and then continue your workflow.
