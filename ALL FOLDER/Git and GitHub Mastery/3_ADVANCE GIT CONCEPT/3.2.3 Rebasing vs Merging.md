Rebasing and merging are both methods for integrating changes from one branch into another in Git. While both achieve a similar outcome – incorporating new code – they differ significantly in how they rewrite the commit history. Rebasing essentially replays your branch's commits on top of the target branch, creating a linear, cleaner history. Merging, on the other hand, creates a new "merge commit" that explicitly joins the two branches, preserving the original history.

The key difference lies in the commit history. Rebasing rewrites history, making it appear as if you branched off the target branch more recently. This results in a simpler, easier-to-follow history, especially beneficial for teams that prioritize a clean commit log. However, rewriting history can be problematic if the branch has already been shared with others, as it can cause confusion and conflicts. Merging, by creating a merge commit, preserves the entire history, showing exactly when and how branches were integrated. This can be useful for auditing and understanding the evolution of the codebase, but can also lead to a more complex and potentially cluttered history.

For example, imagine you have a `feature` branch branched off `main`. You've made several commits on `feature`, and `main` has also advanced. Rebasing `feature` onto `main` would replay your `feature` commits on top of the latest `main`, resulting in a linear history. Merging `main` into `feature` would create a merge commit on `feature` that combines the changes from both branches, preserving the original commit history of both `main` and `feature`. The choice between rebasing and merging depends on your team's workflow and preferences regarding commit history.
