Linking issues to pull requests is a crucial practice for effective project management on GitHub. It creates a clear connection between the proposed code changes and the problem they are intended to solve. This linkage provides valuable context for reviewers, helps automate issue tracking, and ensures that issues are automatically closed when the pull request is merged. By establishing this connection, you improve collaboration, streamline the development workflow, and maintain a well-organized project repository.

You can link an issue to a pull request by including specific keywords in the pull request's description or commit messages. Common keywords include `Closes #issue_number`, `Fixes #issue_number`, or `Resolves #issue_number`. For example, if you're working on a pull request that fixes bug #123, you would include "Fixes #123" in the pull request description. When the pull request is merged, GitHub will automatically close issue #123. Alternatively, you can manually link issues in the pull request sidebar under the "Linked issues" section.

Another example is using the `refs` keyword. `Refs #456` will link the pull request to issue #456, but it _won't_ automatically close the issue upon merging. This is useful when the pull request addresses the issue but doesn't fully resolve it. This allows for more granular control over issue management and ensures that issues are only closed when they are completely resolved.
