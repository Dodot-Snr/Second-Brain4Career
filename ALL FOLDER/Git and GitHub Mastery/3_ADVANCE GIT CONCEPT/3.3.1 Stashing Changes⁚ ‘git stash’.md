Sometimes you're working on a feature, but need to switch branches to address a high-priority bug or pull in the latest changes. You're not ready to commit your current work, but you also don't want to lose it. That's where `git stash` comes in! Stashing allows you to temporarily shelve your modified tracked files and staged changes, reverting your working directory to a clean state. Think of it as a temporary holding area for your in-progress work.

The basic command, `git stash`, saves your changes to a new stash. You can then switch branches, perform other tasks, and later retrieve your stashed changes using `git stash pop` (which applies the stash and removes it from the stash list) or `git stash apply` (which applies the stash but keeps it in the stash list). For example, if you've modified `my_file.txt` and staged `another_file.txt`, running `git stash` will save these changes.

To see a list of your stashes, use `git stash list`. Each stash is given an index (stash@{0}, stash@{1}, etc.). You can then apply a specific stash using its index, like so: `git stash apply stash@{1}`. This allows you to manage multiple stashes and apply them in any order you need.
