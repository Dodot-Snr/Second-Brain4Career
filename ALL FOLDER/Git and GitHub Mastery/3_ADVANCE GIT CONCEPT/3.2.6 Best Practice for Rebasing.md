Rebasing, while powerful, can also be a source of headaches if not used carefully. Following best practices minimizes the risk of introducing errors and ensures a smoother workflow. A core principle is to **only rebase commits that haven't been pushed to a shared remote branch**. Rebasing rewrites history, and if others have based their work on the original commits, rebasing will create divergence and merge conflicts that are difficult to resolve.

One crucial practice is to **rebase frequently and in small increments**. Instead of waiting until a feature branch is significantly behind `main`, rebase regularly to keep it relatively up-to-date. This reduces the likelihood of large, complex conflicts. For example, if you're working on a feature branch `feature/new-ui`, you might run `git rebase origin/main` every day or two to incorporate the latest changes from the `main` branch. Another good practice is to **avoid rebasing public branches**. If you've already pushed your branch to a remote repository where others are collaborating, rebasing can cause significant problems for them.

Finally, **always test thoroughly after rebasing**. Rebasing changes the commit history, so it's essential to ensure that your code still works as expected. Run your unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant tests to catch any regressions introduced by the rebase. If you encounter conflicts during the rebase process, resolve them carefully and test the affected code afterward.
