Choosing between rebasing and merging is a fundamental decision in Git workflows, impacting your project's history and collaboration. Rebasing rewrites history, creating a linear, cleaner project history by moving your branch's commits onto the tip of another branch (usually `main`). Merging, on the other hand, preserves the complete history, including the merge commits, which can sometimes lead to a more complex and branching history.

Generally, **rebase when working on a private branch** that hasn't been shared with others. This keeps your local history clean and makes it easier to understand the changes you've made relative to the target branch. For example, if you're working on a feature branch `feature/new-login` and `main` has advanced, rebasing `feature/new-login` onto `main` before creating a pull request will result in a cleaner, easier-to-review history.

**Merge when working on a shared branch** or when you want to preserve the complete history of your project. Merging is also preferred when you want to explicitly record the integration of different branches. For example, after a pull request is approved, merging `feature/new-login` into `main` will create a merge commit, clearly indicating when and how the feature was integrated. Avoid rebasing public branches as it can cause significant issues for collaborators who have based their work on the original commits.
