Rebasing is a Git process that integrates changes from one branch into another, similar to merging. However, instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing rewrites the commit history of the target branch to make it appear as if it branched off from the destination branch more recently. This results in a cleaner, linear project history, which can be easier to follow.

Imagine you have a feature branch `feature-x` branched off from `main`. While you're working on `feature-x`, `main` receives new commits. Rebasing `feature-x` onto `main` essentially replays your `feature-x` commits on top of the latest `main` commits. This avoids a merge commit and presents a history where `feature-x` was developed directly on top of the most recent `main`.

For example, to rebase your `feature-x` branch onto `main`, you would first checkout `feature-x` using `git checkout feature-x`. Then, you would run the command `git rebase main`. Git will then attempt to apply your `feature-x` commits on top of the current `main`. If conflicts arise during the rebase, you'll need to resolve them before continuing with `git rebase --continue`. Once the rebase is complete, you might need to force-push your branch to the remote repository using `git push --force-with-lease origin feature-x` if you've already pushed it before. Be cautious when force-pushing, especially to shared branches, as it can rewrite history for others.
