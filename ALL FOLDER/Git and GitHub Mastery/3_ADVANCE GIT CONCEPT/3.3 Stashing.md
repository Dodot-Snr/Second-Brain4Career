Stashing in Git is a powerful feature that allows you to temporarily shelve changes you've made in your working directory. This is incredibly useful when you need to switch branches quickly to address a bug or work on a different feature, but you're not ready to commit your current changes. Think of it as a temporary holding area for your modifications. Stashing cleans your working directory, allowing you to switch branches without conflicts.

For example, imagine you're working on a new feature and have made several changes to your code, but you need to urgently fix a bug on the `main` branch. Instead of committing half-finished work, you can use `git stash` to save your changes. After fixing the bug on `main`, you can switch back to your feature branch and use `git stash pop` to retrieve your stashed changes and continue working where you left off. Another common use case is when you pull changes from a remote repository and encounter conflicts with your local modifications. Stashing your local changes allows you to pull the remote changes cleanly and then reapply your stashed changes, resolving any conflicts in a more controlled manner.
