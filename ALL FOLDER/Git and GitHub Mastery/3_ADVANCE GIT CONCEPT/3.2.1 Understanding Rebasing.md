Rebasing is a powerful Git technique that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another, similar to merging. However, instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing rewrites the commit history of the target branch to make it appear as if it branched off from the latest commit of the base branch. This results in a cleaner, linear history, which can be easier to follow and understand.

The primary use case for rebasing is to keep your feature branch up-to-date with the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`). For example, imagine you branched off `feature-branch` from `main` a few days ago. Since then, `main` has had several new commits. Rebasing `feature-branch` onto `main` will replay your `feature-branch` commits on top of the latest `main` commits, effectively integrating the changes from `main` into your feature branch.

A common command for rebasing is:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

This command checks out the `feature-branch` and then rebases it onto `main`. If conflicts arise during the rebase, Git will pause and allow you to resolve them before continuing the rebase process using `git add <resolved_file>` and `git rebase --continue`. Once all conflicts are resolved, the rebase will complete, and your `feature-branch` will have a linear history based on the latest `main`.
