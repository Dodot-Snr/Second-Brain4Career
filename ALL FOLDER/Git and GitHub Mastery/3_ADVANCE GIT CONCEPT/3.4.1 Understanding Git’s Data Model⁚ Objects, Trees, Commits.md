This section dives into the core of Git's architecture, exploring how it stores and manages your project's history. Instead of tracking changes between files, Git uses a content-addressable filesystem. This means everything – files, directories, and even commits – are stored as objects identified by a unique SHA-1 hash of their content. Understanding these objects (blobs, trees, and commits) is crucial for truly grasping how Git works under the hood.

We'll explore the three main object types: _blobs_ which represent file content, _trees_ which represent directories and their contents (pointing to blobs and other trees), and _commits_ which represent snapshots of your project at a specific point in time. A commit points to a single tree (the root directory of that snapshot) and contains metadata like the author, committer, and commit message. For example, imagine you have a file named `hello.txt` with the content "Hello, world!". Git would store this content as a blob object. If you then add this file to your staging area and commit, Git would create a tree object representing the directory containing `hello.txt` (pointing to the blob) and a commit object pointing to that tree.

By understanding how Git represents your project as a series of interconnected objects, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for its efficiency, flexibility, and powerful features like branching and merging. We'll also touch upon how Git uses these objects to reconstruct your project's history and enable features like time travel and collaboration.
