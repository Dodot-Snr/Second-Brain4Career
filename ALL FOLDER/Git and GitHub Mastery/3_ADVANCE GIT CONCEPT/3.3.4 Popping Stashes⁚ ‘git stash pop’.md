The `git stash pop` command is used to remove a specific stash from the stash list and apply its changes to your working directory. Think of it as the opposite of `git stash push`. While `git stash apply` leaves the stash in the stash list, `git stash pop` removes it after applying the changes. This is useful when you're confident you no longer need the stashed changes stored separately.

By default, `git stash pop` will apply the most recently created stash (stash@{0}). However, you can specify a different stash to pop by providing its index. For example, `git stash pop stash@{2}` will apply the changes from the third stash in the list and then remove it from the stash list. If the pop operation results in conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually before committing.

Example:

```bash
git stash pop # Applies and removes the most recent stash
git stash pop stash@{1} # Applies and removes the second stash
```
