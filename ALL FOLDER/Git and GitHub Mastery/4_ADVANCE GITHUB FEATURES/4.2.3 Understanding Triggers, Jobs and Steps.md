GitHub Actions automate tasks within your software development workflow directly in your repository. To effectively use Actions, it's crucial to understand the core concepts of triggers, jobs, and steps. These elements define _when_ an action runs, _what_ it does, and _how_ it does it.

A _trigger_ (or event) is what initiates a workflow. Common triggers include `push` (when code is pushed to the repository), `pull_request` (when a pull request is created or updated), and `schedule` (running workflows on a cron schedule). A _job_ is a set of steps that execute on a runner environment (e.g., a virtual machine). Each job runs independently and can be configured to run in parallel. Finally, a _step_ is an individual task within a job, such as running a shell command, executing a script, or using a pre-built action from the GitHub Marketplace.

For example, you might have a workflow triggered by a `push` event to the `main` branch. This workflow could define a job called "build" that runs on an Ubuntu runner. The "build" job might have steps to checkout the code, install dependencies using `npm install`, and then run tests using `npm test`. Another example is using a `schedule` trigger to run a job that automatically creates a backup of your repository every week.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
