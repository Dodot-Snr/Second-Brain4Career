GitHub Pages provides a simple way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. However, sometimes things don't go as planned, and your site might not deploy correctly or display as expected. This section will equip you with the knowledge to diagnose and resolve common issues encountered when using GitHub Pages. We'll cover common problems like build failures, incorrect URL configurations, and content not updating.

One frequent issue is a build failure, often indicated by an orange or red dot next to your commit on GitHub. This usually stems from errors in your site's code or configuration files. Checking the build logs in the "Actions" tab of your repository is crucial. For example, if you're using Jekyll, a common error is a syntax mistake in your `_config.yml` file. Another common problem is incorrect URL configuration. If your site is hosted at a custom domain, ensure your DNS records are correctly configured and that your `CNAME` file in the repository root contains the correct domain name.

Understanding how to interpret error messages, verify your repository settings, and test your site locally before pushing changes are essential skills for maintaining a smoothly running GitHub Pages site. We'll explore these techniques and more to help you become a proficient GitHub Pages troubleshooter.
