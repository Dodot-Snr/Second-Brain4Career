The GitHub API allows you to programmatically interact with GitHub, automating tasks and integrating GitHub data into your applications. Two primary architectural styles are used for making these API requests: REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL. REST is a widely adopted architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to access and manipulate resources identified by URLs. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language for your API that allows you to request specific data, avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching of information.

Understanding how to make requests using both REST and GraphQL is crucial for effectively utilizing the GitHub API. For example, using REST, you might use a `GET` request to `https://api.github.com/users/octocat` to retrieve information about the user "octocat." With GraphQL, you can construct a query to retrieve only the name and bio of the same user, like this:

```graphql
query {
  user(login: "octocat") {
    name
    bio
  }
}
```

Choosing between REST and GraphQL depends on your specific needs. REST is generally simpler for basic operations, while GraphQL offers more flexibility and efficiency when you need to retrieve specific data or perform complex queries. This section will cover the fundamentals of making API requests using both approaches, including authentication, request formatting, and response handling.
