GitHub Apps are the officially recommended way to integrate with GitHub. They offer granular permissions, allowing you to request only the access you need, and act on behalf of themselves rather than a specific user. This makes them ideal for automating tasks, integrating with other services, and building powerful tools that enhance the GitHub experience. Unlike OAuth Apps, GitHub Apps can perform actions independently, even when a user isn't actively using the application.

Building a GitHub App involves registering the app with GitHub, configuring its permissions and webhooks, and writing code to handle events and interact with the GitHub API. Webhooks are crucial, as they allow your app to receive real-time notifications about events happening in repositories or organizations. For example, you could build an app that automatically labels new issues based on their content or an app that triggers a CI/CD pipeline whenever code is pushed to a repository.

A key example is a "Stale Issue Manager" app. This app could listen for `issues.opened` and `issues.labeled` webhook events. If an issue remains open and unlabeled for a certain period, the app could automatically add a "needs-triage" label. Another example is a "Code Quality Checker" app that listens for `pull_request.synchronize` events. Upon receiving this event, the app could run static analysis tools on the code changes and post comments on the pull request with any identified issues.
