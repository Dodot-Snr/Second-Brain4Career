GitHub Actions workflows are defined using YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) files. These files specify the series of jobs and steps that will be executed when the workflow is triggered. Understanding YAML syntax is crucial for creating effective and maintainable workflows. YAML uses indentation to define the structure and relationships between different elements, making it relatively easy to read and write. Key elements include `name`, `on` (triggering events), `jobs`, and `steps`.

A basic workflow file resides in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. The `name` defines the workflow's display name in the GitHub Actions UI. The `on` section specifies the events that trigger the workflow, such as `push`, `pull_request`, or scheduled events using `cron`. The `jobs` section defines the individual jobs that will be executed, and each job contains a series of `steps`. Each step can execute a shell command, run an action, or perform other tasks.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the basic structure:

```yaml
name: My First Workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  my_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run a script
        run: echo "Hello, world!"
```

In this example, the workflow is triggered on every `push` event. The `my_job` job runs on an Ubuntu virtual machine. The first step checks out the repository's code using the `actions/checkout@v3` action, and the second step executes a simple shell command that prints "Hello, world!".
