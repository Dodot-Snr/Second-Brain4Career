After cloning a repository containing submodules, the submodule directories will exist, but they won't contain any of the submodule's code. This is because Git only tracks the _structure_ of the submodules, not their contents, in the main repository. The `git submodule init` command is crucial for preparing your local environment to work with these submodules. It registers the submodule's configuration, primarily by reading the `.gitmodules` file in the root of your repository and populating the `.git/config` file with the necessary information about each submodule, such as the URL of the submodule's repository.

Running `git submodule init` essentially tells Git where to find the actual submodule repositories. It doesn't actually download the submodule's code; it just sets up the configuration so that subsequent commands, like `git submodule update`, know where to fetch the code from. Think of it as setting up the address book before making any calls.

For example, if your `.gitmodules` file contains an entry like this:

```
[submodule "my_library"]
	path = my_library
	url = https://github.com/example/my_library.git
```

Running `git submodule init` will configure Git to know that the `my_library` submodule, located in the `my_library` directory, should be fetched from `https://github.com/example/my_library.git`. After initialization, you'll typically follow up with `git submodule update --init --recursive` to actually clone the submodule's code into your local repository.
