GitHub Pages provides a simple way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. While the default URL ([username.github.io/repository](http://username.github.io/repository)) is convenient, using a custom domain (like [yourwebsite.com](http://yourwebsite.com)) adds a professional touch and enhances your brand. This involves configuring your domain's DNS records to point to GitHub's servers and updating your GitHub repository with the custom domain information.

The process generally involves adding a `CNAME` file to the root of your GitHub Pages repository containing your custom domain. Then, you'll need to configure your domain registrar's DNS settings. This typically involves creating an `A` record pointing to GitHub's IP addresses (e.g., 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153) and optionally a `CNAME` record pointing `www.yourwebsite.com` to `username.github.io`.

For example, if your custom domain is `example.com`, you would create a file named `CNAME` in your repository's root directory with the following content:

```
example.com
```

After configuring your DNS records, it may take some time for the changes to propagate across the internet. GitHub Pages will automatically provision an SSL certificate for your custom domain, ensuring secure HTTPS access to your website.
