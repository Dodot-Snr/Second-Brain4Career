Subtrees offer an alternative approach to incorporating external projects into your Git repository, providing a different set of trade-offs compared to submodules. Unlike submodules, which maintain a separate Git repository within your main project, subtrees merge the history of the external project directly into your main repository. This means the entire history of the subtree becomes part of your project's history, simplifying some workflows but potentially increasing repository size.

The primary advantage of subtrees is their simplicity in terms of workflow. You don't need to initialize or update submodules separately. Changes to the subtree are simply commits within your main project. For example, if you have a "library" repository you want to include, you can add it as a subtree. To add a subtree, you would use a command like: `git subtree add --prefix=library library-repo main-branch --squash`. This command fetches the `library-repo`'s `main-branch` and merges it into your project under the `library` directory, squashing the history into a single commit for a cleaner initial import.

However, managing updates to the subtree can be more complex. You'll need to use `git subtree pull` to fetch changes from the external repository and merge them into your subtree. Similarly, pushing changes back to the external repository requires `git subtree push`. While subtrees offer a simpler initial setup, managing ongoing synchronization requires careful attention to avoid conflicts and maintain a clean history.
