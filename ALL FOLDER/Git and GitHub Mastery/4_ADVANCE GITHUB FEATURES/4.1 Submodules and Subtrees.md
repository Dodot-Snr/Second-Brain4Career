Submodules and subtrees are both mechanisms in Git for including another repository within your project. They address the need to manage dependencies or incorporate shared codebases. However, they differ significantly in how they achieve this and their impact on your repository's history. Submodules essentially create a pointer within your main repository to a specific commit in another repository. This means the submodule's repository is tracked separately, and changes within the submodule are not automatically reflected in the parent repository until explicitly updated.

Subtrees, on the other hand, merge the entire history of the external repository into your project's history. This creates a single, unified repository. Changes made in the subtree become part of your project's history, and vice versa, if you choose to push changes back to the original repository. Subtrees offer more flexibility in terms of modifying the incorporated code directly within your project, but they can also lead to a more complex and potentially larger repository history.

For example, imagine you have a project that relies on a specific version of a UI library. Using a submodule, you would point to that specific commit in the UI library's repository. Any updates to the UI library would require you to explicitly update the submodule pointer in your project. Conversely, using a subtree, you would merge the UI library's code into your project. You could then modify the UI library code directly within your project, and potentially contribute those changes back to the original UI library repository.
