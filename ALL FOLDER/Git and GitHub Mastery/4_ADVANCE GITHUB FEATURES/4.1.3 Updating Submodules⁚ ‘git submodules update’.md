Once you've cloned a repository containing submodules, or after a collaborator has updated the submodule's commit reference in the main repository, you'll need to update your local submodule directories to reflect those changes. This is where `git submodule update` comes in. This command essentially initializes any uninitialized submodules and then checks out the specific commit that the main repository points to for each submodule.

The most common usage is `git submodule update --init --recursive`. The `--init` flag ensures that any submodules that haven't been initialized yet are initialized (cloned). The `--recursive` flag ensures that if any of your submodules _themselves_ contain submodules, those are also updated. Without `--recursive`, you'd have to manually navigate into each submodule and run `git submodule update` there.

For example, if the main repository's `.gitmodules` file specifies a submodule named `my_library` and the main repository now points to a newer commit in `my_library`, running `git submodule update --init --recursive` will update the `my_library` directory in your local copy to match that commit. If you only want to update a specific submodule, you can specify its path: `git submodule update --init my_library`.
