Jekyll is a static site generator that's deeply integrated with GitHub Pages. It allows you to build websites using Markdown, Liquid templates, HTML, and CSS, and then automatically deploy them to GitHub Pages. This means you can focus on writing content without worrying about server-side code or databases. GitHub Pages natively supports Jekyll, so when you push your Jekyll project to a repository, GitHub's servers will automatically build and deploy your site.

To use Jekyll with GitHub Pages, you typically create a `_config.yml` file to configure your site, write your content in Markdown files (e.g., `index.md`, `about.md`), and use Liquid templates to create reusable layouts and components. For example, you might define a layout in `_layouts/default.html` that includes your site's header and footer, and then use that layout in your Markdown files.

A simple example of a `_config.yml` file might look like this:

```yaml
title: My Awesome Website
description: A website built with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
theme: minima
```

And a basic Markdown file (`index.md`) using a layout could be:

```markdown
---
layout: default
title: Home
---

# Welcome!

This is my awesome website built with Jekyll and deployed to GitHub Pages.
```
