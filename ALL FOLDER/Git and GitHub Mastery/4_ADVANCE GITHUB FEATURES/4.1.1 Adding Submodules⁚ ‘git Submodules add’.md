The `git submodule add` command is used to add an external repository as a submodule within your main Git repository. This allows you to include and track specific versions of another project directly within your project, without merging its entire history. This is particularly useful for managing dependencies or incorporating shared libraries. When you add a submodule, Git creates a special entry in your repository that points to the specific commit of the external repository.

To add a submodule, you use the command `git submodule add <repository_url> <path>`. For example, if you want to include a library called "my-library" from GitHub into your project's "libs" directory, you would run: `git submodule add https://github.com/example/my-library.git libs/my-library`. This command clones the specified repository into the `libs/my-library` directory and adds an entry to the `.gitmodules` file, which tracks the submodule's configuration. After adding the submodule, you need to commit the changes to both the `.gitmodules` file and the newly created submodule directory to your main repository.
