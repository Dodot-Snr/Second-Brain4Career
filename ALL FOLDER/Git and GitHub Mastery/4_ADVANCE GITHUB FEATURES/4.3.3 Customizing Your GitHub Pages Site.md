Once you have a basic GitHub Pages site up and running, you'll likely want to customize its appearance and functionality. This involves modifying the underlying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, or leveraging a static site generator like Jekyll for more advanced features. Customization allows you to create a unique and engaging online presence tailored to your specific needs.

One common customization is adding a custom domain. Instead of your site being accessible at `your-username.github.io`, you can point your own domain (e.g., `your-domain.com`) to your GitHub Pages site. This involves configuring DNS records with your domain registrar and adding the domain to your repository's settings on GitHub. Another example is using a custom theme. You can either create your own CSS styles or use a pre-built theme from a library or framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. To use a custom theme, you would typically link the CSS file in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/custom.css">
```

By exploring these customization options, you can transform a basic GitHub Pages site into a professional and personalized website.
