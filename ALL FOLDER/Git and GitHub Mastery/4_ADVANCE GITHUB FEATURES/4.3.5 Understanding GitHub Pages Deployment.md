GitHub Pages offers a straightforward way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. This is incredibly useful for showcasing personal projects, creating documentation sites, or building simple landing pages. Deployment involves configuring your repository to serve files from a specific branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`) or a dedicated folder (like `/docs`). GitHub then automatically builds and publishes your site, making it accessible via a unique URL based on your GitHub username or organization.

The deployment process is triggered by pushing changes to the designated branch or folder. GitHub Pages supports static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For more complex sites, you can use static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, or Next.js, which GitHub Pages will automatically build if configured correctly. For example, if you have a Jekyll site in your `main` branch, GitHub Pages will recognize the `_config.yml` file and use Jekyll to generate the static site.

A common example is creating a simple portfolio website. You could create an `index.html` file, some CSS, and images, then push them to the `main` branch of your repository. After enabling GitHub Pages in your repository settings and selecting the `main` branch as the source, your website will be live at `yourusername.github.io/yourrepositoryname`. Another example is using a `docs` folder to host documentation generated by a tool like Sphinx.
