GitHub Pages allows you to host a website directly from your GitHub repository. It's a fantastic way to showcase your projects, create a personal portfolio, or build documentation. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or leverage static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo for more complex sites. The beauty of GitHub Pages lies in its simplicity and seamless integration with your existing Git workflow.

There are primarily two types of GitHub Pages sites: user/organization sites and project sites. User/organization sites are hosted from a repository named `username.github.io` (or `organization.github.io`) and represent your personal or organizational presence. Project sites, on the other hand, are hosted from a branch (usually `gh-pages`) or the `/docs` folder of a repository and are typically used to document a specific project. For example, if you have a repository called `my-project`, you could create a `gh-pages` branch and deploy your project's documentation to `username.github.io/my-project`.

To get started, simply create a repository with the appropriate naming convention (for user/organization sites) or configure your repository settings to publish from a specific branch or folder. GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site, making it accessible via a public URL. You can even use a custom domain name for a more professional look.
