GitHub Actions are powerful, but sometimes the pre-built actions don't quite fit your specific needs. That's where custom actions come in! Creating custom actions allows you to encapsulate reusable logic and share it across multiple workflows, keeping your YAML files clean and maintainable. You can write custom actions in JavaScript, Docker containers, or even composite run steps, giving you flexibility in how you implement your automation.

Custom actions can range from simple tasks like formatting code to more complex operations like deploying applications. For example, you might create a JavaScript action to validate commit message formats or a Docker container action to run integration tests in a specific environment. By creating custom actions, you can abstract away the complexity of these tasks and make them easily accessible to your team.

Consider a scenario where you need to consistently apply a specific set of linting rules to your code. Instead of repeating the linting commands in every workflow, you could create a custom action that encapsulates these rules. Another example is creating a Docker container action that builds and pushes a Docker image to a registry based on specific environment variables. This promotes code reuse and reduces the risk of errors.
