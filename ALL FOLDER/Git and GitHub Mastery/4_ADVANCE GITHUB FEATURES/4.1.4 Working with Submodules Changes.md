Submodules, while powerful, introduce complexities when the submodule's content changes. Unlike regular files, Git doesn't automatically track changes _within_ the submodule from the parent repository's perspective. Instead, the parent repository tracks the specific commit of the submodule that it's using. This means that when you make changes inside a submodule, you need to explicitly update the parent repository to point to the new commit.

The typical workflow involves making changes within the submodule, committing those changes _within the submodule's repository_, and then updating the parent repository to point to the new commit. For example, if you modify a file in the `my-submodule` directory, you would first `cd my-submodule`, make your changes, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Updated submodule content"`, and `git push`. Then, back in the parent repository, you would `git add my-submodule` (which stages the updated submodule commit hash), `git commit -m "Updated submodule to latest commit"`, and `git push`.

Failing to update the parent repository after making changes in the submodule can lead to confusion and broken builds. Others cloning the parent repository will get the _old_ version of the submodule unless they explicitly initialize and update the submodules. Remember to always commit and push changes within the submodule _before_ updating the parent repository.
